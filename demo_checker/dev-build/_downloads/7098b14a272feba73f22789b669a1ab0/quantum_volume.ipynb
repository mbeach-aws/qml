Last updated: 15\nApril 2021.*\n\nTwice per year, a project called the TOP500 releases a list of the 500\nmost powerful supercomputing systems in the world. However, there is a\nlarge amount of variation in how supercomputers are built. They may run\ndifferent operating systems and have varying amounts of memory.\n[Some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugaku_(supercomputer)) use 48-core\nprocessors, while\n[others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunway_TaihuLight) use processors\nwith up to 260 cores. The speed of processors will differ, and they may\nbe connected in different ways. We can\\'t rank them by simply counting\nthe number of processors!\n\nIn order to make a fair comparison, we need benchmarking standards that\ngive us a holistic view of their performance. To that end, the TOP500\nrankings are based on something called the LINPACK benchmark. The task\nof the supercomputers is to solve a dense system of linear equations,\nand the metric of interest is the rate at which they perform\n[floating-point operations\n(FLOPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS). Today\\'s top machines\nreach speeds well into the regime of hundreds of petaFLOPS! While a\nsingle number certainly cannot tell the whole story, it still gives us\ninsight into the quality of the machines, and provides a standard so we\ncan compare them.\n\nA similar problem is emerging with quantum computers: we can\\'t judge\nquantum computers on the number of qubits alone. Present-day devices\nhave a number of limitations, an important one being gate error rates.\nTypically the qubits on a chip are not all connected to each other, so\nit may not be possible to perform operations on arbitrary pairs of them.\n\nConsidering this, can we tell if a machine with 20 noisy qubits is\nbetter than one with 5 very high-quality qubits? Or if a machine with 8\nfully-connected qubits is better than one with 16 qubits of comparable\nerror rate, but arranged in a square lattice? How can we make\ncomparisons between different types of qubits?\n\n![..](../demonstrations/quantum_volume/qubit_graph_variety.svg){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nWhich of these qubit hardware graphs is the best?\n\nTo compare across all these facets, researchers have proposed a metric\ncalled \\\"quantum volume\\\". Roughly, the quantum volume is a measure of\nthe effective number of qubits a processor has. It is calculated by\ndetermining the largest number of qubits on which it can reliably run\ncircuits of a prescribed type. You can think of it loosely as a quantum\nanalogue of the LINPACK benchmark. Different quantum computers are\ntasked with solving the same problem, and the success will be a function\nof many properties: error rates, qubit connectivity, even the quality of\nthe software stack. A single number won\\'t tell us everything about a\nquantum computer, but it does establish a framework for comparing them.\n\nAfter working through this tutorial, you\\'ll be able to define quantum\nvolume, explain the problem on which it\\'s based, and run the protocol\nto compute it!\n"

        "Designing a benchmark for quantum computers\n===========================================\n\nThere are many different properties of a quantum computer that\ncontribute to the successful execution of a computation. Therefore, we\nmust be very explicit about what exactly we are benchmarking, and what\nis our measure of success. In general, to set up a benchmark for a\nquantum computer we need to decide on a number of things:\n\n1.  A family of circuits with a well-defined structure and variable size\n2.  A set of rules detailing how the circuits can be compiled\n3.  A measure of success for individual circuits\n4.  A measure of success for the family of circuits\n5.  (Optional) An experimental design specifying how the circuits are to\n    be run\n\nWe\\'ll work through this list in order to see how the protocol for\ncomputing quantum volume fits within this framework.\n\nThe circuits\n------------\n\nQuantum volume relates to the largest *square* circuit that a quantum\nprocessor can run reliably. This benchmark uses *random* square circuits\nwith a very particular form:\n\n![..](../demonstrations/quantum_volume/model_circuit_cross.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"60.0%\"}\n\nA schematic of the random circuit structure used in the quantum volume\nprotocol. Image source:.\n\nSpecifically, the circuits consist of $d$ sequential layers acting on\n$d$ qubits. Each layer consists of two parts: a random permutation of\nthe qubits, followed by Haar-random SU(4) operations performed on\nneighbouring pairs of qubits. (When the number of qubits is odd, the\nbottom-most qubit is idle while the SU(4) operations run on the pairs.\nHowever, it will still be incorporated by way of the permutations.)\nThese circuits satisfy the criteria in item 1 --- they have well-defined\nstructure, and it is clear how they can be scaled to different sizes.\n\nAs for the compilation rules of item 2, to compute quantum volume we\\'re\nallowed to do essentially anything we\\'d like to the circuits in order\nto improve them. This includes optimization, hardware-aware\nconsiderations such as qubit placement and routing, and even resynthesis\nby finding unitaries that are close to the target, but easier to\nimplement on the hardware.\n\nBoth the circuit structure and the compilation highlight how quantum\nvolume is about more than just the number of qubits. The error rates\nwill affect the achievable depth, and the qubit connectivity contributes\nthrough the layers of permutations because a very well-connected\nprocessor will be able to implement these in fewer steps than a\nless-connected one. Even the quality of the software and the compiler\nplays a role here: higher-quality compilers will produce circuits that\nfit better on the target devices, and will thus produce higher quality\nresults.\n\nThe measures of success\n-----------------------\n\nNow that we have our circuits, we have to define the quantities that\nwill indicate how well we\\'re able to run them. For that, we need a\nproblem to solve. The problem used for computing quantum volume is\ncalled the *heavy output generation problem*. It has roots in the\nproposals for demonstrating quantum advantage. Many such proposals make\nuse of the properties of various random quantum circuit families, as the\ndistribution of the measurement outcomes may not be easy to sample using\nclassical techniques.\n\nA distribution that is theorized to fulfill this property is the\ndistribution of *heavy* output bit strings. Heavy bit strings are those\nwhose outcome probabilities are above the median of the distribution.\nFor example, suppose we run a two-qubit circuit and find that the\nmeasurement probabilities for the output states are as follows:\n"

        "Each circuit in a circuit family has its own heavy output probability.\nIf our quantum computer is of high quality, then we should expect to see\nheavy outputs quite often across all the circuits. On the other hand, if\nit\\'s of poor quality and everything is totally decohered, we will end\nup with output probabilities that are roughly all the same, as noise\nwill reduce the probabilities to the uniform distribution.\n\nThe heavy output generation problem quantifies this --- for our family\nof random circuits, do we obtain heavy outputs at least 2/3 of the time\non average? Furthermore, do we obtain this with high confidence? This is\nthe basis for quantum volume. Looking back at the criteria for our\nbenchmarks, for item 3 the measure of success for each circuit is how\noften we obtain heavy outputs when we run the circuit and take a\nmeasurement. For item 4 the measure of success for the whole family is\nwhether or not the mean of these probabilities is greater than 2/3 with\nhigh confidence.\n\nOn a related note, it is important to determine what heavy output\nprobability we should *expect* to see on average. The intuition for how\nthis can be calculated is as follows,. Suppose that our random square\ncircuits scramble things up enough so that the effective operation looks\nlike a Haar-random unitary $U$. Since in the circuits we are applying\n$U$ to the all-zero ket, the measurement outcome probabilities will be\nthe moduli squared of the entries in the first column of $U$.\n\nNow if $U$ is Haar-random, we can say something about the form of these\nentries. In particular, they are complex numbers for which both the real\nand imaginary parts are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance\n$1/2^m$, where $m$ is the number of qubits. Taking the modulus squared\nof such numbers and making a histogram yields a distribution of\nprobabilities with the form $\\hbox{Pr}(p) \\sim 2^m e^{-2^m p}.$ This is\nalso known as the *Porter-Thomas distribution*.\n\nBy looking at the form of the underlying probability distribution, the\nexponential distribution $\\hbox{Pr}(x) = e^{-x}$, we can calculate some\nproperties of the heavy output probabilities. First, we can integrate\nthe exponential distribution to find that the median sits at $\\ln 2$. We\ncan further compute the expectation value of obtaining something greater\nthan the median by integrating $x e^{-x}$ from $\\ln 2$ to $\\infty$ to\nobtain $(1 + \\ln 2)/2$. This is the expected heavy output probability!\nNumerically it is around 0.85, as we will observe later in our results.\n\nThe benchmark\n=============\n\nNow that we have our circuits and our measures of success, we\\'re ready\nto define the quantum volume.\n\n::: {.admonition .defn}\nDefinition\n\nThe quantum volume $V_Q$ of an $n$-qubit processor is defined as\n\n$$\\log_2(V_Q) = \\hbox{argmax}_m \\min (m, d(m))$$\n\nwhere $m \\leq n$ is a number of qubits, and $d(m)$ is the number of\nqubits in the largest square circuits for which we can reliably sample\nheavy outputs with probability greater than 2/3.\n:::\n\nTo see this more concretely, suppose we have a 20-qubit device and find\nthat we get heavy outputs reliably for up to depth-4 circuits on any set\nof 4 qubits, then the quantum volume is $\\log_2 V_Q = 4$. Quantum volume\nis incremental, as shown below --- we gradually work our way up to\nlarger circuits, until we find something we can\\'t do. Very loosely,\nquantum volume is like an effective number of qubits. Even if we have\nthose 20 qubits, only groups of up to 4 of them work well enough\ntogether to sample from distributions that would be considered hard.\n\n![..](../demonstrations/quantum_volume/qv_square_circuits.svg){.align-center\nwidth=\"75.0%\"}\n\nThis quantum computer has $\\log_2 V_Q = 4$, as the 4-qubit square\ncircuits are the largest ones it can run successfully.\n\nThe maximum achieved quantum volume has been doubling at an increasing\nrate. In late 2020, the most recent announcements have been\n$\\log_2 V_Q = 6$ on IBM\\'s 27-qubit superconducting device\n[ibmq\\_montreal]{.title-ref}, and $\\log_2 V_Q = 7$ on a Honeywell\ntrapped-ion qubit processor . A device with an expected quantum volume\nof $\\log_2 V_Q\n= 22$ has also been announced by IonQ, though benchmarking results have\nnot yet been published.\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nIn many sources, the quantum volume of processors is reported as $V_Q$\nexplicitly, rather than $\\log_2 V_Q$ as is the convention in this demo.\nAs such, IonQ\\'s processor has the potential for a quantum volume of\n$2^{22} > 4000000$. Here we use the $\\log$ because it is more\nstraightforward to understand that they have 22 high-quality,\nwell-connected qubits than to extract this at first glance from the\nexplicit value of the volume.\n:::\n"

        "We see that we are $2\\sigma$ above the threshold only for $m=2$, and\n$m=3$. Thus, we find that the quantum volume of our simulated Lima is\n$\\log_2 V_Q = 3$, or $V_Q = 8$, as expected.\n\nThis framework and code will allow you to calculate the quantum volume\nof many different processors. Try it yourself! What happens if we don\\'t\nspecify a large amount of compiler optimization? How does the volume\ncompare across different hardware devices? You can even build your own\ndevice configurations and noise models to explore the extent to which\ndifferent factors affect the volume.\n\nConcluding thoughts\n===================\n\nQuantum volume is a metric used for comparing the quality of different\nquantum computers. By determining the largest square random circuits a\nprocessor can run reliably, it provides a measure of the effective\nnumber of qubits a processor has. Furthermore, it goes beyond just\ngauging quality by a number of qubits --- it incorporates many different\naspects of a device such as its compiler, qubit connectivity, and gate\nerror rates.\n\nHowever, as with any benchmark, it is not without limitations. A key one\nalready discussed is that the heavy output generation problem requires\nus to simulate circuits classically in addition to running them on a\ndevice. While this is perhaps not an issue now, it will surely become\none in the future. The number of qubits continues to increase and error\nrates are getting lower, both of which imply that our square circuits\nwill be growing in both width and depth as time goes on. Eventually they\nwill reach a point where they are no longer classical simulable, and we\nwill have to design new benchmarks.\n\nAnother limitation is that the protocol only looks at one type of\ncircuit, i.e., square circuits. It might be the case that a processor\nhas very few qubits, but also very low error rates. For example, what if\na processor with 5 qubits can run circuits with up to 20 layers? Quantum\nvolume would limit us to $\\log_2 V_Q = 5$ and the high quality of those\nqubits is not reflected in this. To that end, a more general *volumetric\nbenchmark* framework was proposed that includes not only square\ncircuits, but also rectangular circuits [^1]. Investigating very deep\ncircuits on few qubits (and very shallow circuits on many qubits) will\ngive us a broader overview of a processor\\'s quality. Furthermore, the\nflexibility of the framework of[^2] will surely inspire us to create new\ntypes of benchmarks. Having a variety of benchmarks calculated in\ndifferent ways is beneficial and gives us a broader view of the\nperformance of quantum computers.\n\nReferences {#quantum_volume_references}\n==========\n\nAbout the author\n================\n\n[^1]: Blume-Kohout, R., & Young, K.
