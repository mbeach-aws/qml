        "Error mitigation with Mitiq and PennyLane\n=========================================\n\n::: {.meta}\n:property=\\\"og:description\\\": Learn how to mitigate quantum circuits\nusing Mitiq and PennyLane.\n\n:property=\\\"og:image\\\": <https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/laptop.png>\n:::\n\n::: {.related}\ntutorial\\_chemical\\_reactions Modelling chemical reactions on a quantum\ncomputer tutorial\\_noisy\\_circuits Noisy circuits\n:::\n\n*Authors: Tom Bromley (PennyLane) and Andrea Mari (Mitiq) --- Posted: 29\nNovember 2021. Last updated: 29 November 2021.*\n\nHave you ever run a circuit on quantum hardware and not quite got the\nresult you were expecting? If so, welcome to the world of noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices! These devices must function\nin noisy environments and are unable to execute quantum circuits\nperfectly, resulting in outputs that can have a significant error. The\nlong-term plan of quantum computing is to develop a subsequent\ngeneration of error-corrected hardware. In the meantime, how can we best\nutilize our error-prone NISQ devices for practical tasks? One proposed\nsolution is to adopt an approach called error *mitigation*, which aims\nto minimize the effects of noise by executing a family of related\ncircuits and using the results to estimate an error-free value.\n\n![](../demonstrations/error_mitigation/laptop.png){.align-center}\n\nThis demo shows how error mitigation can be carried out by combining\nPennyLane with the [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq)\npackage, a Python-based library providing a range of error mitigation\ntechniques. Integration with PennyLane is available from the `0.11`\nversion of Mitiq, which can be installed using\n\n``` {.bash}\npip install \"mitiq>=0.11\"\n```\n\nWe\\'ll begin the demo by jumping straight into the deep end and seeing\nhow to mitigate a simple noisy circuit in PennyLane with Mitiq as a\nbackend. After, we\\'ll take a step back and discuss the theory behind\nthe error mitigation approach we used, known as zero-noise\nextrapolation. Using this knowledge, we\\'ll give a more detailed\nexplanation of how error mitigation can be carried out in PennyLane. The\nfinal part of this demo showcases the application of mitigation to\nquantum chemistry, allowing us to more accurately calculate the\npotential energy surface of molecular hydrogen.\n\nMitigating noise in a simple circuit\n------------------------------------\n\nWe first need a noisy device to execute our circuit on. Let\\'s keep\nthings simple for now by loading the\n`default.mixed <pennylane.devices.default_mixed>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"mod\"} simulator and artificially adding\n`PhaseDamping <pennylane.PhaseDamping>`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"}\nnoise.\n"

This transform works by intercepting each\ncircuit executed on the device and adding the\n`PhaseDamping <pennylane.PhaseDamping>`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"}\nnoise channel directly after every gate in the circuit. To get a better\nunderstanding of noise channels like\n`PhaseDamping <pennylane.PhaseDamping>`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"},\ncheck out the `tutorial_noisy_circuits`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}\ntutorial.\n\nThe next step is to define our circuit. Inspired by the mirror circuits\nconcept introduced by Proctor *et al.* let\\'s fix a circuit that applies\na unitary $U$ followed by its inverse $U^{\\dagger}$, with $U$ given by\nthe\n`SimplifiedTwoDesign <pennylane.SimplifiedTwoDesign>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"} template. We also fix a measurement of the\n`PauliZ <pennylane.PauliZ>`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"} observable\non our first qubit. Importantly, such a circuit performs an identity\ntransformation $U^{\\dagger} U |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ to any input\nstate $|\\psi\\rangle$ and we can show that the expected value of an ideal\ncircuit execution with an input state $|0\\rangle$ is\n\n$$\\langle 0 | U U^{\\dagger} Z U^{\\dagger} U | 0 \\rangle = 1.$$\n\nAlthough this circuit seems trivial, it provides an ideal test case for\nbenchmarking noisy devices where we expect the output to be less than\none due to the detrimental effects of noise.

Using PennyLane\\'s\n`mitigate_with_zne <pennylane.transforms.mitigate_with_zne>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"func\"} transform, we can create a new `mitigated_qnode` whose\nresult is closer to the ideal noise-free value of `1`. How does this\nwork?\n\nUnderstanding error mitigation\n==============================\n\nError mitigation can be realized through a number of techniques, and the\nMitiq [documentation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a\ngreat resource to start learning more. In this demo, we focus upon the\nzero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) method originally introduced by Temme et\nal. and Li et al..\n\nThe ZNE method works by assuming that the amount of noise present when a\ncircuit is run on a noisy device is enumerated by a parameter $\\gamma$.\nSuppose we have an input circuit that experiences an amount of noise\n$\\gamma = \\gamma_{0}$ when executed. Ideally, we would like to evaluate\nthe result of the circuit in the $\\gamma = 0$ noise-free setting.\n\nTo do this, we create a family of equivalent circuits whose ideal\nnoise-free value is the same as our input circuit. However, when run on\na noisy device, each circuit experiences an amount of noise\n$\\gamma = s \\gamma_{0}$ for some scale factor $s \\ge 1$. By evaluating\nthe noisy outputs of each circuit, we can extrapolate to $s=0$ to\nestimate the result of running a noise-free circuit.\n\nA key element of ZNE is the ability to run equivalent circuits for a\nrange of scale factors $s$. When the noise present in a circuit scales\nwith the number of gates, $s$ can be varied using unitary folding.\nUnitary folding works by noticing that any unitary $V$ is equivalent to\n$V V^{\\dagger} V$. This type of transform can be applied to individual\ngates in the circuit or to the whole circuit. Let\\'s see how folding\nworks in code using Mitiq\\'s\n[fold\\_global](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#mitiq.zne.scaling.folding.fold_global)\nfunction, which folds globally by setting $V$ to be the whole circuit.\nWe begin by making a copy of our above circuit using a\n`QuantumTape <pennylane.tape.QuantumTape>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"}, which provides a low-level approach for circuit\nconstruction in PennyLane.\n"

        "Recall that `circuit` is a PennyLane\n`QuantumTape <pennylane.tape.QuantumTape>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"} and that it should not include measurements. We also use\nthe `executor` function defined earlier that adds on the target\nmeasurement and executes on a noisy device.\n\nMitigating noisy circuits in quantum chemistry\n==============================================\n\nWe\\'re now ready to apply our knowledge to a more practical problem in\nquantum chemistry: calculating the potential energy surface of molecular\nhydrogen. This is achieved by finding the ground state energy of $H_{2}$\nas we increase the bond length between the hydrogen atoms. As shown in\n`this <tutorial_chemical_reactions>`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}\ntutorial, one approach to finding the ground state energy is to\ncalculate the corresponding qubit Hamiltonian and to fix an ansatz\nvariational quantum circuit that returns its expectation value. We can\nthen vary the parameters of the circuit to minimize the energy.\n\nTo find the potential energy surface of $H_{2}$, we must choose a range\nof interatomic distances and calculate the qubit Hamiltonian\ncorresponding to each distance. We then optimize the variational circuit\nwith a new set of parameters for each Hamiltonian and plot the resulting\nenergies for each distance. In this demo, we compare the potential\nenergy surface reconstructed when the optimized variational circuits are\nrun on ideal, noisy, and noise-mitigated devices.\n\nInstead of modifying the\n`default.mixed <pennylane.devices.default_mixed>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"mod\"} device to add simple noise as we do above, let\\'s choose a\nnoise model that is a little closer to physical hardware. Suppose we\nwant to simulate the `ibmq_lima` hardware device available on IBMQ. We\ncan load a noise model that represents this device using:\n"

On the other hand, we\\'ve only just started to scratch the\nsurface of what can be done with error mitigation. We can explore\napplying the ZNE method to other use cases, or even try out other\nmitigation methods like [probabilistic error\ncancellation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/pec-tutorial.html).\nLet us know where your adventures take you, and the Mitiq and PennyLane\nteams will keep working to help make error mitigation as easy as\npossible!\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nAbout the authors\n=================\n"
