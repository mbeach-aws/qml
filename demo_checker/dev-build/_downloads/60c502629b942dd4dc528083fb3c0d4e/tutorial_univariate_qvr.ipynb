The temperature changes as day turns to\nnight, stock markets fluctuate and the bacteria colony living in the\ncoffee cup to your right, which you *promised* you would clean\nyesterday, is slowly growing (seriously, clean it). In many situations,\nit is important to know when these systems start behaving abnormally.\nFor example, if the pressure inside a nuclear fission reactor starts\nviolently fluctuating, you may wish to be alerted of that. The task of\nidentifying such temporally abnormal behaviour is known as time series\nanomaly detection and is well known in machine learning circles.\n\nIn this tutorial, we take a stab at time series anomaly detection using\nthe *Quantum Variational Rewinding* algorithm, or QVR, proposed by\n[Baker, Horowitz, Radha et. al (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16438)\n--- a quantum machine learning algorithm for gate model quantum\ncomputers. QVR leverages the power of unitary time evolution/devolution\noperators to learn a model of *normal* behaviour for time series data.\nGiven a new (i.e., unseen in training) time series, the normal model\nproduces a value that, beyond a threshold, defines anomalous behaviour.\nIn this tutorial, we'll be showing you how all of this works, combining\nelements from [Covalent](https://www.covalent.xyz/),\n[Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).\n\nBefore getting into the technical details of the algorithm, let\\'s get a\nhigh-level overview with the help of the cartoon below.\n"

After the devolved\nstate is measured, the time series is recognized as normal if the\naverage measurement is smaller than a given threshold and anomalous if\nthe threshold is exceeded. In the first case, the time series is\nconsidered rewindable, correctly recovering the initial condition for\nthe life cycle of a butterfly: eggs on a leaf.

        "Background\n==========\n\nTo begin, let's quickly recount the data that QVR handles: time series.\nA general time series $\\boldsymbol{y}$ can be described as a sequence of\n$p$-many observations of a process/system arranged in chronological\norder, where $p$ is a positive integer:\n\n$$\\boldsymbol{y} := (\\boldsymbol{y}_t: t \\in T), \\quad T := (t_l: l \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}_{\\leq p}).$$\n\nIn the simple and didactic case treated in this tutorial,\n$\\boldsymbol{y}$ is univariate (i.e, is a one-dimensional time series),\nso bold-face for $\\boldsymbol{y}$ is dropped from this point onwards.\nAlso, we take $y_t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $t_l \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$.\n\nThe goal of QVR and many other (classical) machine learning algorithms\nfor time series anomaly detection is to determine a suitable *anomaly\nscore* function $a_{X}$, where $X$ is a training dataset of *normal*\ntime series instances $x \\in X$ ($x$ is defined analogously to $y$ in\nthe above), from which the anomaly score function was learnt. When\npassed a general time series $y$, this function produces a real number:\n$a_X(y) \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The goal is to have $a_X(x) \\approx 0$, for all\n$x \\in X$. Then, for an unseen time series $y$ and a threshold\n$\\zeta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the series is said to be anomalous should\n$a_X(y) > \\zeta,$ and normal otherwise. We show a strategy for setting\n$\\zeta$ later in this tutorial.\n\nThe first step for doing all of this *quantumly* is to generate a\nsequence $\\mathcal{S} := (|x_{t} \\rangle: t \\in T)$ of $n$-qubit quantum\nstates corresponding to a classical time series instance in the training\nset. Now, we suppose that each $|x_t \\rangle$ is a quantum state evolved\nto a time $t$, as generated by an *unknown embedding Hamiltonian* $H_E$.\nThat is, each element of $\\mathcal{S}$ is defined by\n$|x_t \\rangle = e^{-iH_E(x_t)}|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n} = U(x_t)|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$\nfor an embedding unitary operator $U(x_t)$ implementing a quantum\nfeature map (see the [Pennylane embedding\ntemplates](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/templates.html#embedding-templates)\nfor efficient quantum circuits for doing so). Next, we operate on each\n$|x_t\\rangle$ with a parameterized\n$e^{-iH(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})t}$ operator to prepare\nthe states\n\n$$|x_t, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\rangle := e^{-iH(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})t}|x_t\\rangle,$$\n\nwhere we write $e^{-iH(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})t}$ as\nan eigendecomposition\n\n$$V_t(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}) := W^{\\dagger}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})D(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}, t)W(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) = e^{-iH(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})t}.$$\n\nHere, the unitary matrix of eigenvectors $W(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$ is\nparametrized by $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ and the unitary diagonalization\n$D(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}, t)$ is parametrized by $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}.$\nBoth can be implemented efficiently using parameterized quantum\ncircuits. The above equality with\n$e^{-iH(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})t}$ is a consequence of\nStone's theorem for strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups.\n\nWe now ask the question: *What condition is required for*\n$|x_t, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma} \\rangle = |0 \\rangle^{\\otimes n}$\n*for all time?* To answer this, we impose\n$P(|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}) = |\\langle 0|^{\\otimes n}|x_t, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma} \\rangle|^2 = 1.$\nPlaying with the algebra a little, we find that the following condition\nmust be satisfied for all $t$:\n\n$$\\langle 0|^{\\otimes n}e^{-iH(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})t}e^{-iH_E(x_t)}|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n} = 1 \\iff  H(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})t = -H_E(x_t).$$\n\nIn other words, for the above to be true, the parameterized unitary\noperator $V_t(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$ should be able\nto reverse or *rewind* $|x_t\\rangle$ to its initial state\n$|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$ before the embedding unitary operator $U(x_t)$\nwas applied.\n\nWe are nearly there! Because it is reasonable to expect that a single\nHamiltonian will not be able to successfully rewind every $x \\in X$ (in\nfact, this is impossible to do if each $x$ is unique, which is usually\ntrue), we consider the average effect of many Hamiltonians generated by\ndrawing $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$ from a normal distribution\n$\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)$ with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation\n$\\sigma$:\n\n$$F(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}, x_t) := \\mathop{\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)}}\\left[\\langle 0|^{\\otimes n} |x_t, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\rangle  \\right], \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\phi} = [\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\mu, \\sigma].$$\n\nThe goal is for the function $F$ defined above to be as close to $1$ as\npossible, for all $x \\in X$ and $t \\in T.$ With this in mind, we can\ndefine the loss function to minimize as the mean square error\nregularized by a penalty function $P_{\\tau}(\\sigma)$ with a single\nhyperparameter $\\tau$:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})} = \\frac{1}{2|X||T|}\\sum_{x \\in X} \\sum_{t \\in T}[1 - F(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}, x_t)]^2 + P_{\\tau}(\\sigma).$$\n\nWe will show the exact form of $P_{\\tau}(\\sigma)$ later. The general\npurpose of the penalty function is to penalize large values of $\\sigma$\n(justification for this is given in the Supplement of). After\napproximately finding the argument $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}^{\\star}$ that\nminimizes the loss function (found using a classical optimization\nroutine), we finally arrive at a definition for our anomaly score\nfunction $a_X(y)$\n\n$$a_X(y) = \\frac{1}{|T|}\\sum_{t \\in T}[1 - F(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}^{\\star}, y_t)]^2.$$\n\nIt may now be apparent that we have implemented a clustering algorithm!\nThat is, our model $F$ was trained such that normal time series\n$x \\in X$ produce $F(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}^{\\star}, x_t)$ clustered about a\ncenter at $1$. Given a new time series $y$, should\n$F(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}^{\\star}, y_t)$ venture far from the normal center\nat $1$, we are observing anomalous behaviour!\n\nTake the time now to have another look at the cartoon at the start of\nthis tutorial. Hopefully things should start making sense now.\n\nNow with our algorithm defined, let's stitch this all together: enter\n[Covalent](https://www.covalent.xyz/).\n"

Learnt the background of how to detect anomalous time series\n    instances, *quantumly*,\n2.  Learnt how to build the code to achieve this using PennyLane and\n    PyTorch, and,\n3.  Learnt the basics of Covalent: a workflow orchestration tool for\n    heterogeneous computation\n\nIf you want to learn more about QVR, you should consult the paper where\nwe generalize the math a little and test the algorithm on less trivial\ntime series data than was dealt with in this tutorial. We also ran some\nexperiments on real quantum computers, enhancing our results using error\nmitigation techniques. If you want to play some more with Covalent,\ncheck us out on [GitHub](https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/) and/or\nengage with other tutorials in our\n[documentation](https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n"
