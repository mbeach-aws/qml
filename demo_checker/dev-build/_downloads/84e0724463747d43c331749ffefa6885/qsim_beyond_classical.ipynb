Last updated: 10\nSeptember 2021.*\n\n![](../demonstrations/qsim_beyond_classical/qc.png){.align-right\nheight=\"4.16667in\"}\n\nIn the paper [Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting\nprocessor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5), the\nGoogle AI Quantum team and collaborators showed that the Sycamore\nquantum processor could complete a task that would take a classical\ncomputer potentially thousands of years. They faced their quantum chip\noff against JEWEL---one of the world\\'s most powerful\nsupercomputers---using a classical statevector simulator called\n[qsim](https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim). The main idea behind this\nshowdown was to prove that a quantum device could solve a specific task\nthat no classical method could do in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nFor the face-off, a pseudo-random quantum circuit was constructed by\nalternating single-qubit and two-qubit gates in a specific, semi-random\npattern. This procedure gives a random unitary transformation which is\ncompatible with the Sycamore hardware. The circuit output is measured\nmany times, producing a set of sampled bitstrings. The more qubits there\nare, and the deeper the circuit is, the more difficult it becomes to\nsimulate and sample this bitstring distribution classically. By\ncomparing run-times for the classical simulations and the Sycamore chip\non smaller circuits, and then extrapolating classical run-times for\nlarger circuits, the team concluded that simulating larger circuits on\nSycamore was intractable classically---i.e., the Sycamore chips had\ndemonstrated what is called \\\"quantum supremacy\\\".\n\nIn this demonstration, we will walk you through how their random quantum\ncircuits were constructed, how the performance was measured via\ncross-entropy benchmarks, and provide reusable examples of their\nclassical simulations.\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nWe will be using PennyLane along with the aformentioned `qsim` simulator\nrunning via our [PennyLane-Cirq\nplugin](https://pennylane-cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). To use the\n`qsim` device you also need to install `qsimcirq`, which is the Python\nmodule interfacing the `qsim` simulator with Cirq.\n:::\n"

        "Classical hardness\n==================\n\nWhy are we calculating this specific fidelity, and what does it actually\nmean if we get a cross-entropy benchmarking fidelity close to 1? This is\nan important question, containing one of the main arguments behind why\nthis experiment is used to demonstrate \\\"quantum supremacy\\\".\n\nMuch is due to the Porter-Thompson probability distribution that the\nrandom quantum circuits follow, which is hard to simulate classically.\nOn the other hand, a quantum device, running a circuit as the one\nconstructed above, should be able to sample from such a distribution\nwithout much overhead. Thus, by showing that a quantum device can\nproduce a high enough fidelity value for a large enough circuit,\n\\\"quantum supremacy\\\" can be claimed. This is exactly what Google\\'s\nexperiment has done.\n\nThere\\'s still one issue that hasn\\'t been touched on yet: the addition\nof noise in quantum hardware. Simply put, this noise will lower the\ncross-entropy benchmarking fidelity---the larger the circuit, the more\nnoise there will be, and thus the lower the fidelity, with the fidelity\napproaching 0 as the noise increases. By calculating the specific\nsingle-qubit, two-qubit, and readout errors of the Sycamore chip, and\nusing them to simulate a noisy circuit, the Google AI quantum team was\nable to compare the run-times with the output from their actual hardware\ndevice. This way, they managed to show that a significant speedup could\nbe gained from using a quantum computer, and thus proclaimed \\\"quantum\nsupremacy\\\" (see Fig. 4 in).\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nFor more reading on this, the original paper is highly recommended\n(along with the suplementary information if you want to dive deeper into\nthe math and physics of the experiment). The blog post in, along with\nthe accompanying GitHub repo, also provides a nice introduction to the\ncross-entropy benchmarking fidelity, and includes calculations\nhighlighting the effects of added noise models.\n:::\n"
