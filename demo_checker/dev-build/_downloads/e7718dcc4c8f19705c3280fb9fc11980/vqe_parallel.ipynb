Last updated: 9\nNovember 2022.*\n\nThis tutorial showcases how using asynchronously-evaluated parallel QPUs\ncan speed up the calculation of the potential energy surface of\nmolecular hydrogen ($H_2$).\n\nUsing a VQE setup, we task two devices from the\n[PennyLane-Rigetti](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/rigetti/en/latest/)\nplugin with evaluating\n\nseparate terms in the qubit Hamiltonian of $H_2$. As these devices are\nallowed to operate asynchronously, i.e., at the same time and without\nhaving to wait for each other, the calculation can be performed in\nroughly half the time.\n\nWe begin by importing the prerequisite libraries:\n"

This is achieved by finding the ground\nstate energy of $H_{2}$ as we increase the bond length between the\nhydrogen atoms.\n\nEach inter-atomic distance results in a different qubit Hamiltonian. To\nfind the corresponding Hamiltonian, we use the\n`~.pennylane.qchem.molecular_hamiltonian`{.interpreted-text role=\"func\"}\nfunction of the `~.pennylane.qchem`{.interpreted-text role=\"mod\"}\npackage. Further details on the mapping from the electronic Hamiltonian\nof a molecule to a qubit Hamiltonian can be found in the\n`tutorial_quantum_chemistry`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"} and\n`tutorial_vqe`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"} tutorials.\n\nWe begin by creating a dictionary containing a selection of bond lengths\nand corresponding data files saved in\n[XYZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format) format.
