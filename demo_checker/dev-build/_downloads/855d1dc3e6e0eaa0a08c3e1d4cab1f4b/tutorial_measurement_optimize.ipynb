Last updated: 8 April\n2021.*\n\nThe variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is the OG variational quantum\nalgorithm. Harnessing near-term quantum hardware to solve for the\nelectronic structure of molecules, VQE is *the* algorithm that sparked\nthe variational circuit craze of the last 5 years, and holds great\npromise for showcasing a quantum advantage on near-term quantum\nhardware. It has also inspired other quantum algorithms such as the\n`Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)\n</demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro>`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}.\n\nTo scale VQE beyond the regime of classical computation, however, we\nneed to solve for the ground state of increasingly larger molecules. A\nconsequence is that the number of measurements we need to make on the\nquantum hardware also grows polynomially---a huge bottleneck, especially\nwhen quantum hardware access is limited and expensive.\n\nTo mitigate this \\'measurement problem\\', a plethora of recent research\ndropped over the course of 2019 and 2020 , exploring potential\nstrategies to minimize the number of measurements required. In fact, by\ngrouping commuting terms of the Hamiltonian, we can significantly reduce\nthe number of measurements needed---in some cases, reducing the number\nof measurements by up to 90%!\n\n![](/demonstrations/measurement_optimize/grouping.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"90.0%\"}\n\nIn this demonstration, we revisit the VQE algorithm, see first-hand how\nthe required number of measurements scales as molecule size increases,\nand finally use these measurement optimization strategies to minimize\nthe number of measurements we need to make. These techniques are\nvaluable beyond just VQE, allowing you to add measurement optimization\nto your toolkit of techniques to perform variational algorithms more\nefficiently.\n\nRevisiting VQE\n--------------\n\nThe study of\n`variational quantum algorithms </glossary/variational_circuit>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"} was spearheaded by the introduction of the\n`variational quantum eigensolver <tutorial_vqe>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"} (VQE) algorithm in 2014. While classical variational\ntechniques have been known for decades to estimate the ground state\nenergy of a molecule, VQE allowed this variational technique to be\napplied using quantum computers. Since then, the field of variational\nquantum algorithms has evolved significantly, with larger and more\ncomplex models being proposed (such as\n`quantum neural networks </demos/quantum_neural_net>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"}, `QGANs </demos/tutorial_QGAN>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"}, and\n`variational classifiers </demos/tutorial_variational_classifier>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"}). However, quantum chemistry remains one of the flagship\nuse-cases for variational quantum algorithms, and VQE the\nstandard-bearer.\n\nPart of the appeal of VQE lies within its simplicity. A circuit ansatz\n$U(\\theta)$ is chosen (typically the Unitary Coupled-Cluster Singles and\nDoubles (`~pennylane.templates.subroutines.UCCSD`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"func\"}) ansatz), and the qubit representation of the molecular\nHamiltonian is computed:\n\n$$H = \\sum_i c_i h_i,$$\n\nwhere $h_i$ are the terms of the Hamiltonian written as a tensor product\nof Pauli operators or the identity acting on wire $n$,\n$P_n \\in \\{I, \\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z\\}$:\n\n$$h_i = \\bigotimes_{n=0}^{N-1} P_n.$$\n\n(The $h_i$ product of Pauli terms is often referred to as a \\'Pauli\nword\\' in the literature.) The cost function of the VQE is then simply\nthe expectation value of this Hamiltonian on the state obtained after\nrunning the variational quantum circuit:\n\n$$\\text{cost}(\\theta) = \\langle 0 | U(\\theta)^\\dagger H U(\\theta) | 0 \\rangle.$$\n\nBy using a classical optimizer to *minimize* this quantity, we can\nestimate the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian $H$:\n\n$$H U(\\theta_{min}) |0\\rangle = E_{min} U(\\theta_{min}) |0\\rangle.$$\n\nIn practice, when we are using quantum hardware to compute these\nexpectation values we expand out the Hamiltonian as its summation,\nresulting in separate expectation values that need to be calculated for\neach term:\n\n$$\\text{cost}(\\theta) = \\langle 0 | U(\\theta)^\\dagger \\left(\\sum_i c_i h_i\\right) U(\\theta) | 0 \\rangle\n                    = \\sum_i c_i \\langle 0 | U(\\theta)^\\dagger h_i U(\\theta) | 0 \\rangle.$$\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nHow do we compute the qubit representation of the molecular Hamiltonian?\nThis is a more complicated story that involves applying a\nself-consistent field method (such as Hartree-Fock), and then performing\na fermionic-to-qubit mapping such as the Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev\ntransformations.\n\nFor more details on this process, check out the\n`/demos/tutorial_quantum_chemistry`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}\ntutorial.\n:::\n\nThe measurement problem\n-----------------------\n\nFor small molecules, the VQE algorithm scales and performs exceedingly\nwell. For example, for the Hydrogen molecule $\\text{H}_2$, the final\nHamiltonian in its qubit representation has 15 terms that need to be\nmeasured. Let\\'s generate this Hamiltonian from the electronic structure\nfile `h2.xyz </demonstrations/h2.xyz>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"download\"}, to verify the number of terms. In this tutorial, we\nuse the `~.pennylane.qchem.read_structure`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"func\"} function to read the geometry of the molecule from an\nexternal file.\n"

        "Simultaneously measuring observables\n====================================\n\nOne of the assumptions we made above was that every term in the\nHamiltonian must be measured independently. However, this might not be\nthe case. From the [Heisenberg uncertainty\nrelationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle) for\ntwo observables $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$, we know that\n\n$$\\sigma_A^2 \\sigma_B^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\left\\langle [\\hat{A}, \\hat{B}] \\right\\rangle\\right|,$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma^2_A$ and $\\sigma^2_B$ are the variances of measuring the\nexpectation value of the associated observables, and\n\n$$[\\hat{A}, \\hat{B}] = \\hat{A}\\hat{B}-\\hat{B}\\hat{A}$$\n\nis the commutator. Therefore,\n\n-   If the two observables $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$ do not commute\n    ($[\\hat{A},\n    \\hat{B}] \\neq 0$), then $\\sigma_A^2\n    \\sigma_B^2 > 0$ and we cannot simultaneously measure the expectation\n    values of the two observables.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   If $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$ **do** commute ($[\\hat{A},\n    \\hat{B}] = 0$), then $\\sigma_A^2\n    \\sigma_B^2 \\geq 0$ and there exists a measurement basis where we can\n    **simultaneously measure** the expectation value of both observables\n    on the same state.\n\nTo explore why commutativity and simultaneous measurement are related,\nlet\\'s assume that there is a complete, orthonormal eigenbasis\n$|\\phi_n\\rangle$ that *simultaneously diagonalizes* both $\\hat{A}$ and\n$\\hat{B}$:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\u2460 ~~ \\hat{A} |\\phi_n\\rangle &= \\lambda_{A,n} |\\phi_n\\rangle,\\\\\n\u2461 ~~ \\hat{B} |\\phi_n\\rangle &= \\lambda_{B,n} |\\phi_n\\rangle.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_{A,n}$ and $\\lambda_{B,n}$ are the corresponding\neigenvalues. If we pre-multiply the first equation by $\\hat{B}$, and the\nsecond by $\\hat{A}$ (both denoted in blue):\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\color{blue}{\\hat{B}}\\hat{A} |\\phi_n\\rangle &= \\lambda_{A,n} \\color{blue}{\\hat{B}}\n  |\\phi_n\\rangle = \\lambda_{A,n} \\color{blue}{\\lambda_{B,n}} |\\phi_n\\rangle,\\\\\n\\color{blue}{\\hat{A}}\\hat{B} |\\phi_n\\rangle &= \\lambda_{B,n} \\color{blue}{\\hat{A}}\n  |\\phi_n\\rangle = \\lambda_{A,n} \\color{blue}{\\lambda_{B,n}} |\\phi_n\\rangle.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe can see that assuming a simultaneous eigenbasis requires that\n$\\hat{A}\\hat{B}|\\phi_n\\rangle = \\hat{B}\\hat{A}|\\phi_n\\rangle$. Or,\nrearranging,\n\n$$(\\hat{A}\\hat{B} - \\hat{B}\\hat{A}) |\\phi_n\\rangle = [\\hat{A}, \\hat{B}]|\\phi_n\\rangle = 0.$$\n\nOur assumption that $|\\phi_n\\rangle$ simultaneously diagonalizes both\n$\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$ only holds true if the two observables commute.\n\nSo far, this seems awfully theoretical. What does this mean in practice?\n\nIn the realm of variational circuits, we typically want to compute\nexpectation values of an observable on a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$. If\nwe have two commuting observables, we now know that they share a\nsimultaneous eigenbasis:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{A} &= \\sum_n \\lambda_{A, n} |\\phi_n\\rangle\\langle \\phi_n|,\\\\\n\\hat{B} &= \\sum_n \\lambda_{B, n} |\\phi_n\\rangle\\langle \\phi_n|.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the expectation values:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\langle\\hat{A}\\rangle &= \\langle \\psi | \\hat{A} | \\psi \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | \\left( \\sum_n\n    \\lambda_{A, n} |\\phi_n\\rangle\\langle \\phi_n| \\right) | \\psi \\rangle = \\sum_n \\lambda_{A,n}\n    |\\langle \\phi_n|\\psi\\rangle|^2,\\\\\n\\langle\\hat{B}\\rangle &= \\langle \\psi | \\hat{B} | \\psi \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | \\left( \\sum_n\n    \\lambda_{B, n} |\\phi_n\\rangle\\langle \\phi_n| \\right) | \\psi \\rangle = \\sum_n \\lambda_{B,n}\n    |\\langle \\phi_n|\\psi\\rangle|^2.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSo, assuming we know the eigenvalues of the commuting observables in\nadvance, if we perform a measurement in their shared eigenbasis (the\n$|\\phi_n\\rangle$), we only need to perform a **single measurement** of\nthe probabilities $|\\langle \\phi_n|\\psi\\rangle|^2$ in order to recover\nboth expectation values! \ud83d\ude0d\n\nFantastic! But, can we use this to reduce the number of measurements we\nneed to perform in the VQE algorithm? To do so, we must find the answer\nto two questions:\n\n1.  How do we determine which terms of the cost Hamiltonian commute?\n2.  How do we rotate the circuit into the shared eigenbasis prior to\n    measurement?\n\nThe answers to these questions aren\\'t necessarily easy nor\nstraightforward. Thankfully, there are some recent techniques we can\nharness to address both.\n"

        "Qubit-wise commuting Pauli terms\n================================\n\nBack when we summarized the VQE algorithm, we saw that each term of the\nHamiltonian is generally represented as a tensor product of Pauli\noperators:\n\n$$h_i = \\bigotimes_{n=0}^{N-1} P_n.$$\n\nLuckily, this tensor product structure allows us to take a bit of a\nshortcut. Rather than consider **full commutativity**, we can consider a\nmore strict condition known as **qubit-wise commutativity** (QWC).\n\nTo start with, let\\'s consider single-qubit Pauli operators and the\nidentity. We know that the Pauli operators commute with themselves as\nwell as the identity, but they do *not* commute with each other:\n\n$$[\\sigma_i, I] = 0, ~~~ [\\sigma_i, \\sigma_i] = 0, ~~~ [\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j] = c \\sigma_k \\delta_{ij}.$$\n\nNow consider two tensor products of Pauli terms, for example\n$X\\otimes Y \\otimes I$ and $X\\otimes I \\otimes Z$. We say that these two\nterms are qubit-wise commuting, since, if we compare each subsystem in\nthe tensor product, we see that every one commutes:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{array}{ | *1c | *1c | *1c | *1c | *1c |}\n  X &\\otimes &Y &\\otimes &I\\\\\n  X &\\otimes &I &\\otimes &Z\n\\end{array} ~~~~ \\Rightarrow ~~~~ [X, X] = 0, ~~~ [Y, I] = 0, ~~~ [I, Z] = 0.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nAs a consequence, both terms must commute:\n\n$$[X\\otimes Y \\otimes I, X\\otimes I \\otimes Z] = 0.$$\n\n::: {.important}\n::: {.title}\nImportant\n:::\n\nQubit-wise commutativity is a **sufficient** but not **necessary**\ncondition for full commutativity. For example, the two Pauli terms\n$Y\\otimes Y$ and $X\\otimes X$ are not qubit-wise commuting, but do\ncommute (have a go verifying this!).\n:::\n\nOnce we have identified a qubit-wise commuting pair of Pauli terms, it\nis also straightforward to find the gates to rotate the circuit into the\nshared eigenbasis. To do so, we simply rotate each qubit one-by-one\ndepending on the Pauli operator we are measuring on that wire:\n\n```{=html}\n<style>\n    .docstable {\n        max-width: 300px;\n    }\n    .docstable tr.row-even th, .docstable tr.row-even td {\n        text-align: center;\n    }\n    .docstable tr.row-odd th, .docstable tr.row-odd td {\n        text-align: center;\n    }\n</style>\n<div class=\"d-flex justify-content-center\">\n```\n::: {.rst-class}\ndocstable\n\n  --------------------------------------------------\n  Observable         Rotation gate\n  ------------------ -------------------------------\n  $X$                $RY(-\\pi/2) = H$\n\n  $Y$                $RX(\\pi/2)=HS^{-1}=HSZ$\n\n  $Z$                $I$\n\n  $I$                $I$\n  --------------------------------------------------\n:::\n\n```{=html}\n</div>\n```\nTherefore, in this particular example:\n\n-   Wire 0: we are measuring both terms in the $X$ basis, apply the\n    Hadamard gate\n-   Wire 1: we are measuring both terms in the $Y$ basis, apply a\n    $RX(\\pi/2)$ gate\n-   Wire 2: we are measuring both terms in the $Z$ basis (the\n    computational basis), no gate needs to be applied.\n\nLet\\'s use PennyLane to verify this.\n"

        "Grouping QWC terms\n==================\n\nA nice example is provided in showing how we might tackle this. Say we\nhave the following Hamiltonian defined over four qubits:\n\n$$H = Z_0 + Z_0 Z_1 + Z_0 Z_1 Z_2 + Z_0 Z_1 Z_2 Z_3 + X_2 X_3 + Y_0 X_2 X_3 + Y_0 Y_1 X_2 X_3,$$\n\nwhere we are using the shorthand\n$P_0 P_2 = P\\otimes I \\otimes P \\otimes I$ for brevity. If we go through\nand work out which Pauli terms are qubit-wise commuting, we can\nrepresent this in a neat way using a graph:\n\n![](/demonstrations/measurement_optimize/graph1.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nIn the above graph, every node represents an individual Pauli term of\nthe Hamiltonian, with edges connecting terms that are qubit-wise\ncommuting. Groups of qubit-wise commuting terms are represented as\n**complete subgraphs**. Straight away, we can make an observation: there\nis no unique solution for partitioning the Hamiltonian into groups of\nqubit-wise commuting terms! In fact, there are several solutions:\n\n![](/demonstrations/measurement_optimize/graph2.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"90.0%\"}\n\nOf course, of the potential solutions above, there is one that is more\noptimal than the others \\-\\--on the bottom left, we have partitioned the\ngraph into *two* complete subgraphs, as opposed to the other solutions\nthat require three complete subgraphs. If we were to go with this\nsolution, we would be able to measure the expectation value of the\nHamiltonian using two circuit evaluations.\n\nThis problem---finding the minimum number of complete subgraphs of a\ngraph---is actually quite well known in graph theory, where it is\nreferred to as the [minimum clique cover\nproblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_cover) (with \\'clique\\'\nbeing another term for a complete subgraph).\n\nUnfortunately, that\\'s where our good fortune ends---the minimum clique\ncover problem is known to be\n[NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness), meaning there is\nno known (classical) solution to finding the optimum/minimum clique\ncover in polynomial time.\n\nThankfully, there is a silver lining: we know of polynomial-time\nalgorithms for finding *approximate* solutions to the minimum clique\ncover problem. These heuristic approaches, while not guaranteed to find\nthe optimum solution, scale quadratically with the number of nodes in\nthe graph/terms in the Hamiltonian, so work reasonably well in practice.\n\nMany of these heuristic approaches have roots in another graph problem\nknown as [graph\ncolouring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring); the assignment\nof colours to the graph\\'s vertices such that no adjacent vertices have\nthe same colour. How is this related to the minimum clique cover\nproblem, though? If we take our QWC graph above, and generate the\n[complement graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph) by\ndrawing edges between all *non*-adjacent nodes,\n\n![](/demonstrations/measurement_optimize/graph3.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nwe see that solving the minimum clique cover problem on the QWC graph is\nequivalent to solving the graph colouring problem on the complement\ngraph using the minimum possible number of colours. While there are\nvarious different heuristic algorithms, a common one is [greedy\ncolouring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring#Greedy_coloring);\nin fact, the open-source graph package [NetworkX even provides a\nfunction for greedy\ncolouring](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable//reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color.html#networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color),\n`nx.greedy_color`.\n\nLet\\'s give this a go, using NetworkX to solve the minimum clique\nproblem for observable grouping. First, we\\'ll need to generate the QWC\ngraph (with each node corresponding to a Hamiltonian term, and edges\nindicating two terms that are QWC).\n"
