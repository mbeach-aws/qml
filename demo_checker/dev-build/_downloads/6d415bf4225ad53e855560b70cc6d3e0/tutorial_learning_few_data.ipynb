        "Generalization in QML from few training data {#learning_few_data}\n============================================\n\n::: {.meta}\n:property=\\\"og:description\\\": Generalization of quantum machine learning\nmodels. :property=\\\"og:image\\\":\n<https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/few_data_thumbnail.png>\n:::\n\n::: {.related}\ntutorial\\_local\\_cost\\_functions Alleviating barren plateaus with local\ncost functions\n:::\n\n*Authors: Korbinian Kottmann, Luis Mantilla Calderon, Maurice Weber ---\nPosted: 29 August 2022*\n\nIn this tutorial, we dive into the generalization capabilities of\nquantum machine learning models. For the example of a [Quantum\nConvolutional Neural Network\n(QCNN)](https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/qcnn.html), we show how its\ngeneralization error behaves as a function of the number of training\nsamples. This demo is based on the paper *\\\"Generalization in quantum\nmachine learning from few training data\\\"*. by Caro et al..\n\nWhat is generalization in (Q)ML?\n--------------------------------\n\nWhen optimizing a machine learning model, be it classical or quantum, we\naim to maximize its performance over the data distribution of interest\n(e.g., images of cats and dogs). However, in practice, we are limited to\na finite amount of data, which is why it is necessary to reason about\nhow our model performs on new, previously unseen data. The difference\nbetween the model\\'s performance on the true data distribution and the\nperformance estimated from our training data is called the\n*generalization error*, and it indicates how well the model has learned\nto generalize to unseen data. Generalization can be seen as a\nmanifestation of the bias-variance trade-off; models that perfectly fit\nthe training data admit a low bias at the cost of a higher variance, and\nhence typically perform poorly on unseen test data. In the classical\nmachine learning community, this trade-off has been extensively studied\nand has led to optimization techniques that favour generalization, for\nexample, by regularizing models via their variance. Below, we see a\ncanoncial example of this trade-off, with a model having low bias, but\nhigh variance and therefore high generalization error. The low variance\nmodel, on the other hand, has a higher bias but generalizes better.\n\n![](/demonstrations/learning_few_data/overfitting.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"65.0%\"}\n\nLet us now dive deeper into generalization properties of quantum machine\nlearning (QML) models. We start by describing the typical data\nprocessing pipeline of a QML model. A classical data input $x$ is first\nencoded in a quantum state via a mapping $x \\mapsto \\rho(x)$. This\nencoded state is then processed through a quantum channel\n$\\rho(x) \\mapsto \\mathcal{E}_\\alpha(\\rho(x))$ with learnable parameters\n$\\alpha$. Finally, a measurement is performed on the resulting state to\nget the final prediction. Now, the goal is to minimize the expected loss\nover the data-generating distribution $P$, indicating how well our model\nperforms on new data. Mathematically, for a loss function $\\ell$, the\nexpected loss, denoted by $R$, is given by\n\n$$R(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\sim P}[\\ell(\\alpha;\\,x,\\,y)]$$\n\nwhere $x$ are the features, $y$ are the labels, and $P$ is their joint\ndistribution. In practice, as the joint distribution $P$ is generally\nunknown, this quantity has to be estimated from a finite amount of data.\nGiven a training set $S = \\{(x_i,\\,y_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$ with $N$ samples, we\nestimate the performance of our QML model by calculating the average\nloss over the training set\n\n$$R_S(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\ell(\\alpha;\\,x_i,\\,y_i),$$\n\nwhich is referred to as the training loss and is an unbiased estimate of\n$R(\\alpha)$. This is only a proxy to the true quantity of interest\n$R(\\alpha)$, and their difference is called the generalization error\n\n$$\\mathrm{gen}(\\alpha) =  R(\\alpha) - \\hat{R}_S(\\alpha),$$\n\nwhich is the quantity that we explore in this tutorial. Keeping in mind\nthe bias-variance trade-off, one would expect that more complex models,\ni.e. models with a larger number of parameters, achieve a lower error on\nthe training data but a higher generalization error. Having more\ntraining data, on the other hand, leads to a better approximation of the\ntrue expected loss and hence a lower generalization error. This\nintuition is made precise in Ref., where it is shown that\n$\\mathrm{gen}(\\alpha)$ roughly scales as $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T / N})$,\nwhere $T$ is the number of parametrized gates and $N$ is the number of\ntraining samples.\n"

        "Generalization bounds for QML models\n====================================\n\nAs hinted at earlier, we expect the generalization error to depend both\non the richness of the model class, as well as on the amount of training\ndata available. As a first result, the authors of Ref. found that for a\nQML model with at most $T$ parametrized local quantum channels, the\ngeneralization error depends on $T$ and $N$ according to\n\n$$\\mathrm{gen}(\\alpha) \\sim \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{T\\log T}{N}}\\right).$$\n\nWe see that this scaling is in line with our intuition that the\ngeneralization error scales inversely with the number of training\nsamples and increases with the number of parametrized gates. However, as\nis the case for [quantum convolutional neural networks\n(QCNNs)](https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/qcnn.html), it is possible to\nget a more fine-grained bound by including knowledge on the number of\ngates $M$ which have been reused (i.e. whose parameters are shared\nacross wires). Naively, one could suspect that the generalization error\nscales as $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{MT/N})$ by directly applying the\nabove result (and where $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}$ includes logarithmic\nfactors). However, the authors of Ref. found that such models actually\nadhere to the better scaling\n\n$$\\mathrm{gen}(\\alpha) \\sim \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{T\\log MT}{N}}\\right).$$\n\nWith this, we see that for QCNNs to have a generalization error\n$\\mathrm{gen}(\\alpha)\\leq\\epsilon$, we need a training set of size\n$N \\sim T \\log MT / \\epsilon^2$. For the special case of QCNNs, we can\nexplicitly connect the number of samples needed for good generalization\nto the system size $n$ since these models use $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(n))$\nindependently parametrized gates, each of which is used at most $n$\ntimes. Putting the pieces together, we find that a training set of size\n\n$$N \\sim \\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{poly}(\\log n))$$\n\nis sufficient for the generalization error to be bounded by\n$\\mathrm{gen}(\\alpha) \\leq \\epsilon$. In the next part of this tutorial,\nwe will illustrate this result by implementing a QCNN to classify\ndifferent digits in the classical `digits` dataset. Before that, we set\nup our QCNN.\n"

        "Quantum convolutional neural networks\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\--Before\nwe start building a QCNN, let us briefly review the idea of classical\nCNNs, which have shown tremendous success in tasks like image\nrecognition, recommender systems, and sound classification, to name a\nfew. For a more in-depth explanation of CNNs, we highly recommend\n[chapter 9](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/convnets.html) in.\nClassical CNNs are a family of neural networks which make use of\nconvolutions and pooling operations to insert an inductive bias,\nfavouring invariances to spatial transformations like translations,\nrotations, and scaling. A *convolutional layer* consists of a small\nkernel (a window) that sweeps over a 2D array representation of an image\nand extracts local information while sharing parameters across the\nspatial dimensions. In addition to the convolutional layers, one\ntypically uses pooling layers to reduce the size of the input and to\nprovide a mechanism for summarizing information from a neighbourhood of\nvalues in the input. On top of reducing dimensionality, these types of\nlayers have the advantage of making the model more agnostic to certain\ntransformations like scaling and rotations. These two types of layers\nare applied repeatedly in an alternating manner as shown in the figure\nbelow.\n\n![A graphical representation of a CNN.

        "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe key takeaway of this work is that some quantum learning models can\nachieve high-fidelity predictions using a few training data points. We\nimplemented a model known as the quantum convolutional neural network\n(QCNN) using PennyLane for a binary classification task. Using six\nqubits, we have trained the QCNN to distinguish between handwritten\ndigits of $0$\\'s and $1$\\'s. With $80$ samples, we have achieved a model\nwith accuracy greater than $97\\%$ in $100$ training epochs. Furthermore,\nwe have compared the test and train accuracy of this model for a\ndifferent number of training samples and found the scaling of the\ngeneralization error agrees with the theoretical bounds obtained in[^1].\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nAbout the authors\n=================\n\n[^1]: Matthias C.
