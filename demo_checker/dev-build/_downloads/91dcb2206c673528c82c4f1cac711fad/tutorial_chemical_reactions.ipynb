        "Modelling chemical reactions on a quantum computer\n==================================================\n\n::: {.meta}\n:property=\\\"og:description\\\": Construct potential energy surfaces for\nchemical reactions :property=\\\"og:image\\\":\n<https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/reaction.png>\n:::\n\n::: {.related}\ntutorial\\_quantum\\_chemistry Building molecular Hamiltonians\ntutorial\\_vqe A brief overview of VQE\n:::\n\n*Authors: Varun Rishi and Juan Miguel Arrazola --- Posted: 23 July 2021.\nLast updated: 21 February 2023.*\n\nThe term \\\"chemical reaction\\\" is another name for the transformation of\nmolecules -- the breaking and forming of bonds. They are characterized\nby an energy barrier that determines the likelihood that a reaction\ntakes place. The energy landscapes formed by these barriers are the key\nto understanding how chemical reactions occur, at the deepest possible\nlevel.\n\n![An example chemical\nreaction.](/demonstrations/vqe_bond_dissociation/reaction.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to use PennyLane to simulate\nchemical reactions by constructing potential energy surfaces for\nmolecular transformations. In the process, you will learn how quantum\ncomputers can be used to calculate equilibrium bond lengths, activation\nenergy barriers, and reaction rates. As illustrative examples, we use\ntools implemented in PennyLane to study diatomic bond dissociation and\nreactions involving the exchange of hydrogen atoms.\n\nPotential Energy Surfaces\n-------------------------\n\n[Potential energy surfaces\n(PES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy_surface) describe\nthe energy of molecules for different positions of its atoms. The\nconcept originates from the fact that the electrons are much lighter\nthan protons and neutrons, so they will adjust instantaneously to the\nnew positions of the nuclei. This leads to a separation of the nuclear\nand electronic parts of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, meaning we only need\nto solve the electronic equation:\n\n$$H(R)|\\Psi \\rangle =  E|\\Psi\\rangle.$$\n\nFrom this perspective arises the concept of the electronic energy of a\nmolecule, $E(R)$, as a function of nuclear coordinates $R$. The energy\n$E(R)$ is the expectation value of the molecular Hamiltonian,\n$E(R)=\\langle \\Psi_0|H(R)|\\Psi_0\\rangle$, taken with respect to the\nground state $|\\Psi_0(R)\\rangle$. The potential energy surface is\nprecisely this function $E(R)$, which connects energies to different\ngeometries of the molecule. It gives us a visual tool to understand\nchemical reactions by associating stable molecules (reactants and\nproducts) with local minima, transition states with peaks, and by\nidentifying the possible routes for a chemical reaction to occur.\n\nTo build the potential energy surface, we compute the energy for fixed\npositions of the nuclei, and subsequently adjust the positions of the\nnuclei in incremental steps, computing the energies at each new\nconfiguration. The obtained set of energies corresponds to a grid of\nnuclear positions and the plot of $E(R)$ gives rise to the potential\nenergy surface.\n\n![Illustration of a potential energy surface for a diatomic\nmolecule.](/demonstrations/vqe_bond_dissociation/pes.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"75.0%\"}\n\nBond dissociation in a Hydrogen molecule\n----------------------------------------\n\nWe now construct a potential energy surface and use it to compute\nequilibrium bond lengths and the bond dissociation energy. We begin with\nthe simplest of molecules: $H_2$. The formation or breaking of the $H-H$\nbond is also the most elementary of all reactions:\n\n$$H_2 \\rightarrow H + H.$$\n\nUsing a minimal [basis\nset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STO-nG_basis_sets), this molecular\nsystem can be described by two electrons in four spin-orbitals. When\nmapped to a qubit representation, we need a total of four qubits. The\n*Hartree-Fock (HF) state* is represented as $|1100\\rangle$, where the\ntwo lowest-energy orbitals are occupied, and the remaining two are\nunoccupied.\n\nWe design a quantum circuit consisting of\n`~.pennylane.SingleExcitation`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"} and\n`~.pennylane.DoubleExcitation`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"} gates\napplied to the Hartree-Fock state. This circuit will be optimized to\nprepare ground states for different configurations of the molecule.\n"

        "Hydrogen Exchange Reaction\n==========================\n\nAfter studying a simple diatomic bond dissociation, we move to a\nslightly more complicated case: a hydrogen exchange reaction.\n\n$$H_2 + H \\rightarrow H + H_2.$$\n\nThis reaction has a barrier, the [transition\nstate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_state), that must be\ncrossed for the exchange of an atom to be complete.

These results can\nthen be used to calculate activation energies and reaction rates. The\ngoal (and challenge!) for quantum computing is to improve both hardware\nand algorithms to reach the regime where providing accurate simulations\nbecomes intractable for existing methods.
