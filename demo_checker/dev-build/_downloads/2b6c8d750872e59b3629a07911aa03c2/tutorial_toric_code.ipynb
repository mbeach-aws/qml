Posted: 08 August 2022.*\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThe *toric code model* is a treasure trove of interesting physics and\nmathematics. The model sparked the development of the error-correcting\nsurface codes, an essential category of error correction models. But why\nis the model so useful for error correction?\n\nWe delve into mathematics and condensed matter physics to answer that\nvery question. Viewing the model as a description of spins in an exotic\nmagnet allows us to start analyzing the model as a material. What kind\nof material is it? The toric code is an example of a topological state\nof matter.\n\nA state of matter, or phase, cannot become a different phase without\nsome discontinuity in the physical properties as coefficients in the\nHamiltonian change. This discontinuity may exist in an arbitrary order\nderivative or non-local observable. For example, ice cannot become water\nwithout a discontinuity in density as the temperature changes. The\nground state of a **topological** state of matter cannot smoothly deform\nto a non-entangled state without a phase transition. Entanglement, and\nmore critically *long-range* entanglement, is a key hallmark of a\ntopological state of matter.\n\nLocal measurements cannot detect topological states of matter. We have\nto consider the entire system to determine a topological phase. To\nbetter consider this type of property, consider the parity of the number\nof dancers on a dance floor. Does everyone have a partner, or is there\nan odd person out? To measure that, we have to look at the entire\nsystem.\n\nTopology is the study of global properties that are preserved under\ncontinuous deformations. For example, a coffee cup is equivalent to a\ndonut because they both have a single hole. More technically, they both\nhave an [Euler\ncharacteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic) of\nzero. When we zoom to a local patch, both a sphere and a torus look the\nsame. Only by considering the object as a whole can you detect the\nsingle hole.\n\n![A donut can be smoothly deformed into a\nmug.](../demonstrations/toric_code/torus_to_cup.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nIn this demo, we will look at the degenerate ground state and the\nexcitations of the toric code model. The toric code was initially\nproposed in \"Fault-tolerant quantum computation by anyons\" by Kitaev.\nThis demo was inspired by \"Realizing topologically ordered states on a\nquantum processor\" by K. J. Satzinger et al. For further reading, I\nrecommend \"Quantum Spin Liquids\" by Lucile Savary and Leon Balents and\n\\\"A Pedagogical Overview on 2D and 3D Toric Codes and the Origin of\ntheir Topological Orders\\\".\n\nThe Model\n=========\n\nWhat is the source of all this fascinating physics? The Hamiltonian is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{H} = -\\sum_s S_s - \\sum_p P_p,$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$S_s = \\prod_{i \\in s} Z_i \\quad P_p = \\prod_{j \\in p} X_j.$$\n\nIn the literature, the $S_s$ terms are called the \"star\" operators, and\nthe $P_p$ terms are called the \"plaquette\" operators. Each star $s$ and\nplaquette $p$ is a group of 4 sites on a square lattice. You can compare\nthis model to something like the [Heisenberg\nmodel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Heisenberg_model) used to\ndescribe spins interacting magnetically in a material.\n\nIn the most common formulation of the model, sites live on the edges of\na square lattice. In this formulation, the \"plaquette\" operators are\nproducts of Pauli X operators on all the sites in a square, and the\n\\\"star\\\" operators are products of Pauli Z operators on all the sites\nbordering a vertex.\n\nInstead, we can view the model as a checkerboard of alternating square\ntypes. In this formulation, all sites $i$ and $j$ are the vertices of a\nsquare lattice. Each square is a group of four sites, and adjacent\nsquares alternate between the two types of groups. Since the groups on\nthis checkerboard no longer look like stars and plaquettes, we will call\nthem the \"Z Group\" and \"X Group\" operators in this tutorial.\n\n![On the left, sites are grouped into stars around vertices and\nplaquettes on the faces. On the right, we view the lattice as a\ncheckerboard of alternating types of\ngroups.](../demonstrations/toric_code/stars_plaquettes2.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nWe will be embedding the lattice on a torus via periodic boundary\nconditions. Periodic boundary conditions basically \"glue\" the bottom of\nthe lattice to the top of the lattice and the left to the right.\n\nModular arithmetic accomplishes this matching. Any site at `(x,y)` is\nthe same as a site at `(x+width, y+height)`.\n\n![By matching up the edges with periodic boundary conditions, we turn a\nsquare grid into a\ntorus.](../demonstrations/toric_code/converting_to_torus.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nOn to some practical coding! First, let\\'s define the sites on a\n$4\\times 6$ lattice.\n"

        "The Ground State\n================\n\nWhile individual X and Z operators do not commute with each other, the X\nGroup and Z Group operators do:\n\n$$[S_s, P_p] = 0.$$\n\nSince they commute, the wavefunction can be an eigenstate of each group\noperator independently. To minimize the energy of the Hamiltonian on the\nsystem as a whole, we can minimize the contribution of each group\noperator. Due to the negative coefficients in the Hamiltonian, we need\nto maximize the expectation value of each operator. The maximum possible\nexpectation value for each operator is $+1$. We can turn this into a\nconstraint on our ground state:\n\n$$S_s |G \\rangle = +1 |G \\rangle \\qquad \\qquad P_p | G \\rangle = +1 |G\\rangle.$$\n\nThe wavefunction\n\n$$| G \\rangle =  \\prod_{p} \\frac{\\mathbb{I} + P_p}{\\sqrt{2}} |00\\dots 0\\rangle = \\prod_{p} U_p |00\\dots 0 \\rangle,$$\n\nwhere $P_p$ (plaquette) denotes an X Group operator, is such a state.\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nTo check your understanding, confirm that this ground state obeys the\nconstraints using pen and paper.\n:::\n\n$|G \\rangle$ contains a product of unitaries $U_p$. If we can figure out\nhow to apply a single $U_p$ using a quantum computer\\'s operations, we\ncan apply that decomposition for every $p$ in the product.\n\nTo better understand how to decompose $U_p$, let's write it concretely\nfor a single group of four qubits:\n\n$$U |0000 \\rangle =\n\\frac{\\left(\\mathbb{I} + X_1 X_2 X_3 X_4 \\right)}{\\sqrt{2}} |0000 \\rangle\n= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |0000\\rangle + |1111\\rangle \\right).$$\n\nThis [generalized GHZ\nstate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger_state)\ncan be prepared with a Hadamard and 3 CNOT gates:\n\n![](../demonstrations/toric_code/generalized_ghz_draw.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nThis decomposition for $U_p$ holds only when the initial Hadamard qubit\nbegins in the $|0\\rangle$ state, so we need to be careful in the choice\nof the Hadamard\\'s qubit. This restriction is why we rotated the order\nfor a single X Group on the right border earlier.\n\nWe will also not need to prepare the final X Group that contains the\nfour edges of the lattice.\n\nNow let's actually put these together into a circuit!\n"

        "Excitations\n===========\n\nQuasiparticles allow physicists to describe complex systems as\ninteracting particles in a vacuum. Examples of quasiparticles include\nelectrons and holes in semiconductors, phonons, and magnons.\n\nImagine trying to describe the traffic on the road. We could either\nexplicitly enumerate the location of each vehicle or list the positions\nand severities of traffic jams.\n\nThe first option provides complete information about the system but is\nmuch more challenging to analyze. For most purposes, we can work with\ninformation about how the traffic deviates from a baseline. In\nsemiconductors, we don't write out the wave function for every single\nelectron. We instead use electrons and holes. Neither quasiparticle\nelectrons nor holes are fundamental particles like an electron or\npositron in a vacuum. Instead, they are useful descriptions of how the\nwave function differs from its ground state.\n\nWhile the electrons and holes of a metal behave just like electrons and\npositrons in a vacuum, some condensed matter systems contain\nquasiparticles that cannot or do not exist as fundamental particles. The\nexcitations of the toric code are one such example. To find these\nquasiparticles, we look at states that are *almost* the ground state,\nsuch as the ground state with a single operator applied to it.\n\nSuppose we apply a perturbation to the ground state in the form of a\nsingle X gate at location $i$ :\n\n$$| \\phi \\rangle = X_i | G \\rangle.$$\n\nTwo Z group operators $S_s$ contain individual Z operators at that same\nsite $i$. The noise term $X_i$ will anti-commute with both of these\ngroup operators:\n\n$$S_s X_i = \\left( Z_i Z_a Z_b Z_c \\right) X_i = - X_i S_s.$$\n\nUsing this relation, we can determine the expectation value of the Z\ngroup operators with the altered state:\n\n$$S_s |\\phi\\rangle = S_s X_i |G\\rangle = - X_i S_s |G\\rangle = - X_i |G\\rangle = - |\\phi\\rangle.$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\\langle \\phi | S_s | \\phi \\rangle = -1.$$\n\n$S_s$ now has an expectation value of $-1$.\n\nApplying a single X operator noise term changes the expectation value of\n*two* Z group operators.\n\nThis analysis repeats for the effect of a Z operator on the X Group\nmeasurement. A single Z operator noise term changes the expectation\nvalues of *two* X group operators.\n\nEach group with a negative expectation value is considered an\nexcitation. In the literature, you will often see a Z Group excitation\n$\\langle S_s \\rangle = -1$ called an \"electric\" $e$ excitation and an X\nGroup excitation $\\langle P_p \\rangle = -1$ called a \"magnetic\" $m$\nexcitation. You may also see the inclusion of an identity $\\mathbb{I}$\nparticle for the ground state and the combination particle $\\Psi$\nconsisting of a single $e$ and a single $m$ excitation.\n\nLet's create a QNode where we can apply these perturbations:\n"
