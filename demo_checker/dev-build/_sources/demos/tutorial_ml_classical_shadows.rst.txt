Storing and processing a complete description of an :math:`n`-qubit quantum mechanical
system is challenging because the amount of memory required generally scales exponentially
with the number of qubits. The quantum community has recently addressed this challenge by using
the :doc:`classical shadow <tutorial_classical_shadows>` formalism, which allows us to build more concise classical descriptions
of quantum states using randomized single-qubit measurements. It was argued in Ref. [#preskill]_
that combining classical shadows with classical machine learning enables using learning models
that efficiently predict properties of the quantum systems, such as the expectation value of a
Hamiltonian, correlation functions, and entanglement entropies.

   Combining machine learning and classical shadows


In this demo, we describe one of the ideas presented in Ref. [#preskill]_ for using classical
shadow formalism and machine learning to predict the ground-state properties of the
2D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. We begin by learning how to build the Heisenberg model,
calculate its ground-state properties, and compute its classical shadow. Finally, we demonstrate
how to use :doc:`kernel-based learning models <tutorial_kernels_module>` to predict ground-state properties from the learned
classical shadows. So let's get started!

Building the 2D Heisenberg Model
---------------------------------

We define a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic `Heisenberg model
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Heisenberg_model>`__ as a square
lattice, where a spin-1/2 particle occupies each site. The antiferromagnetic
nature and the overall physics of this model depend on the couplings
:math:`J_{ij}` present between the spins, as reflected in the Hamiltonian
associated with the model:

.. math::  H = \sum_{i < j} J_{ij}(X_i X_j + Y_i Y_j + Z_i Z_j) .

Here, we consider the family of Hamiltonians where all the couplings :math:`J_{ij}`
are sampled uniformly from [0, 2]. We build a coupling matrix :math:`J` by providing
the number of rows :math:`N_r` and columns :math:`N_c` present in the square lattice.
The dimensions of this matrix are :math:`N_s \times N_s`, where :math:`N_s = N_r \times N_c`
is the total number of spin particles present in the model.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-87

For this demo, we study a model with four spins arranged on the nodes of
a square lattice. We require four qubits for simulating this model;
one qubit for each spin. We start by building a coupling matrix ``J_mat``
using our previously defined function.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 94-96

We can now visualize the model instance by representing the coupling matrix as a
``networkx`` graph:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 115-118

We then use the same coupling matrix ``J_mat`` to obtain the Hamiltonian
:math:`H` for the model we have instantiated above.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 137-142

For the Heisenberg model, a property of interest is usually the two-body
correlation function :math:`C_{ij}`, which for a pair of spins :math:`i`
and :math:`j` is defined as the following operator:

.. math::  \hat{C}_{ij} = \frac{1}{3} (X_i X_j + Y_iY_j + Z_iZ_j).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 153-159

The expectation value of each such operator :math:`\hat{C}_{ij}` with respect to
the ground state :math:`|\psi_{0}\rangle` of the model can be used to build
the correlation matrix :math:`C`:

.. math:: {C}_{ij} = \langle \hat{C}_{ij} \rangle = \frac{1}{3} \langle \psi_{0} | X_i X_j + Y_iY_j + Z_iZ_j | \psi_{0} \rangle .


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 162-167

Hence, to build :math:`C` for the model, we need to calculate its
ground state :math:`|\psi_{0}\rangle`. We do this by diagonalizing
the Hamiltonian for the model. Then, we obtain the eigenvector corresponding
to the smallest eigenvalue.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 176-179

We then build a circuit that initializes the qubits into the ground
state and measures the expectation value of the provided set of observables.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 191-195

Finally, we execute this circuit to obtain the exact correlation matrix
:math:`C`. We compute the correlation operators :math:`\hat{C}_{ij}` and
their expectation values with respect to the ground state :math:`|\psi_0\rangle`.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 215-217

Once built, we can visualize the correlation matrix:

Constructing Classical Shadows
------------------------------


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 239-257

Now that we have built the Heisenberg model, the next step is to construct
a :doc:`classical shadow <tutorial_classical_shadows>` representation for its ground state. To construct an
approximate classical representation of an :math:`n`-qubit quantum state :math:`\rho`,
we perform randomized single-qubit measurements on :math:`T`-copies of
:math:`\rho`. Each measurement is chosen randomly among the Pauli bases
:math:`X`, :math:`Y`, or :math:`Z` to yield random :math:`n` pure product
states :math:`|s_i\rangle` for each copy:

.. math:: |s_{i}^{(t)}\rangle \in \{|0\rangle, |1\rangle, |+\rangle, |-\rangle, |i+\rangle, |i-\rangle\}.

.. math::  S_T(\rho) = \big\{|s_{i}^{(t)}\rangle: i\in\{1,\ldots, n\},\ t\in\{1,\ldots, T\} \big\}.

Each of the :math:`|s_i^{(t)}\rangle` provides us with a snapshot of the
state :math:`\rho`, and the :math:`nT` measurements yield the complete
set :math:`S_{T}`, which requires just :math:`3nT` bits to be stored
in classical memory. This is discussed in further detail in our previous
demo about :doc:`classical shadows <tutorial_classical_shadows>`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 267-271

To prepare a classical shadow for the ground state of the Heisenberg
model, we simply reuse the circuit template used above and reconstruct
a ``QNode`` utilizing a device that performs single-shot measurements.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 277-281

Now, we define a function to build the classical shadow for the quantum
state prepared by a given :math:`n`-qubit circuit using :math:`T`-copies
of randomized Pauli basis measurements


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 305-310

Furthermore, :math:`S_{T}` can be used to construct an approximation
of the underlying :math:`n`-qubit state :math:`\rho` by averaging over :math:`\sigma_t`:

.. math::  \sigma_T(\rho) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{1}^{T} \big(3|s_{1}^{(t)}\rangle\langle s_1^{(t)}| - \mathbb{I}\big)\otimes \ldots \otimes \big(3|s_{n}^{(t)}\rangle\langle s_n^{(t)}| - \mathbb{I}\big).


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 344-359

To see how well the reconstruction works for different values of :math:`T`,
we look at the `fidelity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_of_quantum_states>`_
of the actual quantum state with respect to the reconstructed quantum state from
the classical shadow with :math:`T` copies. On average, as the number of copies
:math:`T` is increased, the reconstruction becomes more effective with average
higher fidelity values (orange) and lower variance (blue). Eventually, in the
limit :math:`T\rightarrow\infty`, the reconstruction will be exact.

   Fidelity of the reconstructed ground state with different shadow sizes :math:`T`


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 362-372

The reconstructed quantum state :math:`\sigma_T` can also be used to
evaluate expectation values :math:`\text{Tr}(O\sigma_T)` for some localized
observable :math:`O = \bigotimes_{i}^{n} P_i`, where :math:`P_i \in \{I, X, Y, Z\}`.
However, as shown above, :math:`\sigma_T` would be only an approximation of
:math:`\rho` for finite values of :math:`T`. Therefore, to estimate
:math:`\langle O \rangle` robustly, we use the median of means
estimation. For this purpose, we split up the :math:`T` shadows into
:math:`K` equally-sized groups and evaluate the median of the mean
value of :math:`\langle O \rangle` for each of these groups.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 406-409

Now we estimate the correlation matrix :math:`C^{\prime}` from the
classical shadow approximation of the ground state.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 432-436

This time, let us visualize the deviation observed between the exact correlation
matrix (:math:`C`) and the estimated correlation matrix (:math:`C^{\prime}`)
to assess the effectiveness of classical shadow formalism.

Training Classical Machine Learning Models
------------------------------------------


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 458-490

There are multiple ways in which we can combine classical shadows and
machine learning. This could include training a model to learn
the classical representation of quantum systems based on some system
parameter, estimating a property from such learned classical representations,
or a combination of both. In our case, we consider the problem of using
:doc:`kernel-based models <tutorial_kernel_based_training>` to learn the ground-state representation of the
Heisenberg model Hamiltonian :math:`H(x_l)` from the coupling vector :math:`x_l`,
where :math:`x_l = [J_{i,j} \text{ for } i < j]`. The goal is to predict the
correlation functions :math:`C_{ij}`:

.. math::  \big\{x_l \rightarrow \sigma_T(\rho(x_l)) \rightarrow \text{Tr}(\hat{C}_{ij} \sigma_T(\rho(x_l))) \big\}_{l=1}^{N}.

Here, we consider the following kernel-based machine learning model [#neurtangkernel]_:

.. math::  \hat{\sigma}_{N} (x) = \sum_{l=1}^{N} \kappa(x, x_l)\sigma_T (x_l) = \sum_{l=1}^{N} \left(\sum_{l^{\prime}=1}^{N} k(x, x_{l^{\prime}})(K+\lambda I)^{-1}_{l, l^{\prime}} \sigma_T(x_l) \right),

where :math:`\lambda > 0` is a regularization parameter in cases when
:math:`K` is not invertible, :math:`\sigma_T(x_l)` denotes the classical
representation of the ground state :math:`\rho(x_l)` of the Heisenberg
model constructed using :math:`T` randomized Pauli measurements, and
:math:`K_{ij}=k(x_i, x_j)` is the kernel matrix with
:math:`k(x, x^{\prime})` as the kernel function.

Similarly, estimating an expectation value on the predicted ground state
:math:`\sigma_T(x_l)` using the trained model can then be done by
evaluating:

.. math::  \text{Tr}(\hat{O} \hat{\sigma}_{N} (x)) = \sum_{l=1}^{N} \kappa(x, x_l)\text{Tr}(O\sigma_T (x_l)).

We train the classical kernel-based models using :math:`N = 70`
randomly chosen values of the coupling matrices :math:`J`.

First, to build the dataset, we use the function ``build_dataset`` that
takes as input the size of the dataset (``num_points``), the topology of
the lattice (``Nr`` and ``Nc``), and the number of randomized
Pauli measurements (:math:`T`) for the construction of classical shadows.
The ``X_data`` is the set of coupling vectors that are defined as a
stripped version of the coupling matrix :math:`J`, where only non-duplicate
and non-zero :math:`J_{ij}` are considered. The ``y_exact`` and
``y_clean`` are the set of correlation vectors, i.e., the flattened
correlation matrix :math:`C`, computed with respect to the ground-state
obtained from exact diagonalization and classical shadow representation
(with :math:`T=500`), respectively.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 548-557

Now that our dataset is ready, we can shift our focus to the ML models.
Here, we use two different Kernel functions: (i) Gaussian Kernel and
(ii) Neural Tangent Kernel. For both of them, we consider the
regularization parameter :math:`\lambda` from the following set of values:

.. math::  \lambda = \left\{ 0.0025, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 \right\}.

Next, we define the kernel functions :math:`k(x, x^{\prime})` for each
of the mentioned kernels:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 559-567

.. math::  k(x, x^{\prime}) = e^{-\gamma||x - x^{\prime}||^{2}_{2}}. \tag{Gaussian Kernel}

For the Gaussian kernel, the hyperparameter
:math:`\gamma = N^{2}/\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} ||x_i-x_j||^{2}_{2} > 0`
is chosen to be the inverse of the average Euclidean distance
:math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`. The kernel is implemented using the
radial-basis function (rbf) kernel in the ``sklearn`` library.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 569-576

.. math::  k(x, x^{\prime}) = k^{\text{NTK}}(x, x^{\prime}). \tag{Neural Tangent Kernel}

The neural tangent kernel :math:`k^{\text{NTK}}` used here is equivalent
to an infinite-width feed-forward neural network with four hidden
layers and that uses the rectified linear unit (ReLU) as the activation
function. This is implemented using the ``neural_tangents`` library.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 597-605

For the above two defined kernel methods, we obtain the best learning
model by performing hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation for
the prediction task of each :math:`C_{ij}`. For this purpose, we
implement the function ``fit_predict_data``, which takes input as the
correlation function index ``cij``, kernel matrix ``kernel``, and internal
kernel mapping ``opt`` required by the kernel-based regression models
from the ``sklearn`` library.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 653-656

We perform the fitting and prediction for each :math:`C_{ij}` and print
the output in a tabular format.

    # For each C_ij print (best_cv_score, test_score) pair



















.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 684-694

Overall, we find that the models with the Gaussian kernel performed
better than those with NTK for predicting the expectation value
of the correlation function :math:`C_{ij}` for the ground state of
the Heisenberg model. However, the best choice of :math:`\lambda`
differed substantially across the different :math:`C_{ij}` for both
kernels. We present the predicted correlation matrix :math:`C^{\prime}`
for randomly selected Heisenberg models from the test set below for
comparison against the actual correlation matrix :math:`C`, which is
obtained from the ground state found using exact diagonalization.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 732-743

Finally, we also attempt to showcase the effect of the size of training data
:math:`N` and the number of Pauli measurements :math:`T`. For this, we look
at the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) in prediction for each kernel
over all two-point correlation functions :math:`C_{ij}`. Here, the first
plot looks at the different training sizes :math:`N` with a fixed number of
randomized Pauli measurements :math:`T=100`. In contrast, the second plot
looks at the different shadow sizes :math:`T` with a fixed training data size
:math:`N=70`. The performance improvement seems to be saturating after a
sufficient increase in :math:`N` and :math:`T` values for all two kernels
in both the cases.

Conclusion
----------

This demo illustrates how classical machine learning models can benefit from
the classical shadow formalism for learning characteristics and predicting
the behavior of quantum systems. As argued in Ref. [#preskill]_, this raises
the possibility that models trained on experimental or quantum data data can
effectively address quantum many-body problems that cannot be solved using
classical methods alone.
