*Authors: Maggie Li, Lana Bozanic, Sukin Sim — Posted: 06 November 2020. Last updated: 08 April 2021.*

This tutorial showcases how one can apply quantum natural gradients (QNG) [#stokes2019]_ [#yamamoto2019]_
to accelerate the optimization step of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm [#peruzzo2014]_.
We will implement two small examples: estimating the ground state energy of a single-qubit VQE
problem, which we can visualize using the Bloch sphere, and the hydrogen molecule.

Before going through this tutorial, we recommend that readers refer to the
:doc:`QNG tutorial </demos/tutorial_quantum_natural_gradient>` and
:doc:`VQE tutorial </demos/tutorial_vqe>` for overviews
of quantum natural gradient and the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, respectively.
Let's get started!


Single-qubit VQE example
------------------------

The first step is to import the required libraries and packages:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-43

For this simple example, we consider the following single-qubit Hamiltonian: :math:`\sigma_x + \sigma_z`.

We define the device:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-50

For the variational ansatz, we use two single-qubit rotations, which the user may recognize
from a previous :doc:`tutorial </demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation>` on qubit rotations.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-61

We then define our cost function which supports the computation of
block-diagonal or diagonal approximations to the Fubini-Study metric tensor [#stokes2019]_. This tensor is a
crucial component for optimizing with quantum natural gradients.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-79

To analyze the performance of quantum natural gradient on VQE calculations,
we set up and execute optimizations using the ``GradientDescentOptimizer`` (which does not
utilize quantum gradients) and the ``QNGOptimizer`` that uses the block-diagonal approximation
to the metric tensor.

To perform a fair comparison, we fix the initial parameters for the two optimizers.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 84-87

We will carry out each optimization over a maximum of 500 steps. As was done in the VQE
tutorial, we aim to reach a convergence tolerance of around :math:`10^{-6}`.
We use a step size of 0.01.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 93-94

First, we carry out the VQE optimization using the standard gradient descent method.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 128-129

We then repeat the process for the optimizer employing quantum natural gradients:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 164-170

Visualizing the results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For single-qubit examples, we can visualize the optimization process in several ways.

For example, we can track the energy history:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 181-184

Or we can visualize the optimization path in the parameter space using a contour plot.
Energies at different grid points have been pre-computed, and they can be downloaded by
clicking :download:`here<../demonstrations/vqe_qng/param_landscape.npy>`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 184-238

.. code-block:: default


    # Discretize the parameter space



    # Load energy value at each point in parameter space


    # Plot energy landscape






    # Plot optimization path for gradient descent. Plot every 10th point.

















    # Plot optimization path for quantum natural gradient descent. Plot every 10th point.



























.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 239-266

Here, the blue regions indicate states with lower energies, and the red regions indicate
states with higher energies. We can see that the ``QNGOptimizer`` takes a more direct
route to the minimum in larger strides compared to the path taken by the ``GradientDescentOptimizer``.

Lastly, we can visualize the same optimization paths on the Bloch sphere using routines
from `QuTiP <http://qutip.org/>`__. The result should look like the following:

.. figure:: /demonstrations/vqe_qng/opt_paths_bloch.png
    :width: 50%
    :align: center

where again the black markers and line indicate the path taken by the ``QNGOptimizer``,
and the green markers and line indicate the path taken by the ``GradientDescentOptimizer``.
Using this visualization method, we can clearly see how the path using the ``QNGOptimizer`` tightly
"hugs" the curvature of the Bloch sphere and takes the shorter path.

Now, we will move onto a more interesting example: estimating the ground state energy
of molecular hydrogen.

Hydrogen VQE Example
--------------------

To construct our system Hamiltonian, we first read the molecular geometry from
the external file :download:`h2.xyz </demonstrations/h2.xyz>` using the
:func:`~.pennylane.qchem.read_structure` function (see more details in the
:doc:`tutorial_quantum_chemistry` tutorial). The molecular Hamiltonian is then
built using the :func:`~.pennylane.qchem.molecular_hamiltonian` function.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 276-280

For our ansatz, we use the circuit from the
`VQE tutorial <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe.html>`__
but expand out the arbitrary single-qubit rotations to elementary
gates (RZ-RY-RZ).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 296-299

Note that the qubit register has been initialized to :math:`|1100\rangle`, which encodes for
the Hartree-Fock state of the hydrogen molecule described in the minimal basis.
Again, we define the cost function to be the following QNode that measures ``expval(H)``:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 306-308

For this problem, we can compute the exact value of the
ground state energy via exact diagonalization. We provide the value below.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 313-314

We now set up our optimizations runs.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 322-324

As was done with our previous VQE example, we run the standard gradient descent
optimizer.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 361-363

Next, we run the optimizer employing quantum natural gradients. We also need to make the
Hamiltonian coefficients non-differentiable by setting ``requires_grad=False``.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 400-406

Visualizing the results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To evaluate the performance of our two optimizers, we can compare: (a) the
number of steps it takes to reach our ground state estimate and (b) the quality of our ground
state estimate by comparing the final optimization energy to the exact value.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 417-421

We see that by employing quantum natural gradients, it takes fewer steps
to reach a ground state estimate and the optimized energy achieved by
the optimizer is lower than that obtained using vanilla gradient descent.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 423-455

Robustness in parameter initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While results above show a more rapid convergence for quantum natural gradients,
what if we were just lucky, i.e., we started at a "good" point in parameter space?
How do we know this will be the case with high probability regardless of the
parameter initialization?

Using the same system Hamiltonian, ansatz, and device, we tested the robustness
of the ``QNGOptimizer`` by running 10 independent trials with random parameter initializations.
For this numerical test, our optimizer does not terminate based on energy improvement; we fix the number of
iterations to 200.
We show the result of this test below (after pre-computing), where we plot the mean and standard
deviation of the energies over optimization steps for quantum natural gradient and standard gradient descent.

.. figure:: ../demonstrations/vqe_qng/k_runs_.png
    :align: center
    :width: 60%
    :target: javascript:void(0)

We observe that quantum natural gradient on average converges faster for this system.

.. note::

    While using QNG may help accelerate the VQE algorithm in terms of optimization steps,
    each QNG step is more costly than its vanilla gradient descent counterpart due to
    a greater number of calls to the quantum computer that are needed to compute the Fubini-Study metric tensor.

While further benchmark studies are needed to better understand the advantages
of quantum natural gradient, preliminary studies such as this tutorial show the potentials
of the method. 🎉
