        "Computing gradients in parallel with Amazon Braket\n==================================================\n\n::: {.meta}\n:property=\\\"og:description\\\": Parallelize gradient calculations with\nAmazon Braket :property=\\\"og:image\\\":\n<https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/pl-braket.png>\n:::\n\n::: {.related}\ntutorial\\_qaoa\\_intro Intro to QAOA vqe\\_parallel VQE with parallel QPUs\nwith Rigetti\n:::\n\n*Authors: Tom Bromley and Maria Schuld --- Posted: 08 December 2020.\nLast updated: 30 September 2021.*\n\nPennyLane integrates with [Amazon\nBraket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) to enable quantum machine\nlearning and optimization on high-performance simulators and quantum\nprocessing units (QPUs) through a range of\n[providers](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/hardware-providers/).\n\nIn PennyLane, Amazon Braket is accessed through the\n[PennyLane-Braket](https://amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.readthedocs.io)\nplugin. The plugin can be installed using\n\n``` {.bash}\npip install amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin\n```\n\nA central feature of Amazon Braket is that its remote simulator can\nexecute multiple circuits in parallel. This capability can be harnessed\nin PennyLane during circuit training, which requires lots of variations\nof a circuit to be executed. Hence, the PennyLane-Braket plugin provides\na method for scalable optimization of large circuits with many\nparameters. This tutorial will explain the importance of this feature,\nallow you to benchmark it yourself, and explore its use for solving a\nscaled-up graph problem with QAOA.\n\n![](../_static/remote-multi-job-simulator.png){.align-center}\n\nWhy is training circuits so expensive?\n--------------------------------------\n\nQuantum-classical hybrid optimization of quantum circuits is the\nworkhorse algorithm of near-term quantum computing. It is not only\nfundamental for training variational quantum circuits, but also more\nbroadly for applications like quantum chemistry and quantum machine\nlearning. Today\\'s most powerful optimization algorithms rely on the\nefficient computation of gradients---which tell us how to adapt\nparameters a little bit at a time to improve the algorithm.\n\nCalculating the gradient involves multiple device executions: for each\ntrainable parameter we must execute our circuit on the device typically\n`more than once </glossary/parameter_shift>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"}. Reasonable applications involve many trainable parameters\n(just think of a classical neural net with millions of tunable weights).\nThe result is a huge number of device executions for each optimization\nstep.\n\n![](../_static/grad-circuits.png){.align-center}\n\nIn the standard `default.qubit` device, gradients are calculated in\nPennyLane through sequential device executions---in other words, all\nthese circuits have to wait in the same queue until they can be\nevaluated. This approach is simpler, but quickly becomes slow as we\nscale the number of parameters. Moreover, as the number of qubits, or\n\\\"width\\\", of the circuit is scaled, each device execution will slow\ndown and eventually become a noticeable bottleneck. In short---\\**the\nfuture of training quantum circuits relies on high-performance remote\nsimulators and hardware devices that are highly parallelized*\\*.\n\nFortunately, the PennyLane-Braket plugin provides a solution for\nscalable quantum circuit training by giving access to the Amazon Braket\nsimulator known as\n[SV1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-devices.html).\nSV1 is a high-performance state vector simulator that is designed with\nparallel execution in mind. Together with PennyLane, we can use SV1 to\nrun in parallel all the circuits needed to compute a gradient!\n\nAccessing devices on Amazon Braket\n----------------------------------\n\nThe remote simulator and quantum hardware devices available on Amazon\nBraket can be found\n[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-devices.html).\nEach device has a unique identifier known as an\n[ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).\nIn PennyLane, all remote Braket devices are accessed through a single\nPennyLane device named `braket.aws.qubit`, along with specification of\nthe corresponding ARN.\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nTo access remote services on Amazon Braket, you must first create an\naccount on AWS and also follow the [setup\ninstructions](https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python#prerequisites)\nfor accessing Braket from Python.\n:::\n\nLet\\'s load the SV1 simulator in PennyLane with 25 qubits. We must\nspecify both the ARN and the address of the [S3\nbucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) where results are to be stored:\n"
