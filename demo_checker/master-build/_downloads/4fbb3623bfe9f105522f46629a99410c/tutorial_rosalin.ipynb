Last updated: 30 January\n2023.*\n\nIn this tutorial we investigate and implement the Rosalin (Random\nOperator Sampling for Adaptive Learning with Individual Number of shots)\nfrom Arrasmith et al.. In this paper, a strategy is introduced for\nreducing the number of shots required when optimizing variational\nquantum algorithms, by both:\n\n-   Frugally adapting the number of shots used per parameter update, and\n-   Performing a weighted sampling of operators from the cost\n    Hamiltonian.\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nThe Rosalin optimizer is available in PennyLane via the\n`~.pennylane.ShotAdaptiveOptimizer`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"}.\n:::\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nWhile a large number of papers in variational quantum algorithms focus\non the choice of circuit ansatz, cost function, gradient computation, or\ninitialization method, the optimization strategy---an important\ncomponent affecting both convergence time and quantum resource\ndependence---is not as frequently considered. Instead, common\n\\'out-of-the-box\\' classical optimization techniques, such as\ngradient-free methods (COBLYA, Nelder-Mead), gradient-descent, and\nHessian-free methods (L-BFGS) tend to be used.\n\nHowever, for variational algorithms such as\n`VQE </demos/tutorial_vqe>`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}, which involve\nevaluating a large number of non-commuting operators in the cost\nfunction, decreasing the number of quantum evaluations required for\nconvergence, while still minimizing statistical noise, can be a delicate\nbalance.\n\nRecent work has highlighted that \\'quantum-aware\\' optimization\ntechniques can lead to marked improvements when training variational\nquantum algorithms:\n\n-   `/demos/tutorial_quantum_natural_gradient`{.interpreted-text\n    role=\"doc\"} descent by Stokes et al., which takes into account the\n    quantum geometry during the gradient-descent update step.\n-   The work of Sweke et al., which shows that quantum gradient descent\n    with a finite number of shots is equivalent to [stochastic gradient\n    descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent),\n    and has guaranteed convergence. Furthermore, combining a finite\n    number of shots with weighted sampling of the cost function terms\n    leads to `/demos/tutorial_doubly_stochastic`{.interpreted-text\n    role=\"doc\"}.\n-   The iCANS (individual Coupled Adaptive Number of Shots) optimization\n    technique by Jonas Kuebler et al. adapts the number of shots\n    measurements during training, by maximizing the expected gain per\n    shot.\n\nIn this latest result by Arrasmith et al., the idea of doubly stochastic\ngradient descent has been used to extend the iCANS optimizer, resulting\nin faster convergence.\n\nOver the course of this tutorial, we will explore their results;\nbeginning first with a demonstration of *weighted random sampling* of\nthe cost Hamiltonian operators, before combining this with the\nshot-frugal iCANS optimizer to perform doubly stochastic Rosalin\noptimization.\n\nWeighted random sampling\n------------------------\n\nConsider a Hamiltonian $H$ expanded as a weighted sum of operators $h_i$\nthat can be directly measured:\n\n$$H = \\sum_{i=1}^N c_i h_i.$$\n\nDue to the linearity of expectation values, the expectation value of\nthis Hamiltonian can be expressed as the weighted sum of each individual\nterm:\n\n$$\\langle H\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^N c_i \\langle h_i\\rangle.$$\n\nIn the\n`doubly stochastic gradient descent demonstration </demos/tutorial_doubly_stochastic>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"}, we estimated this expectation value by **uniformly\nsampling** a subset of the terms at each optimization step, and\nevaluating each term by using the same finite number of shots $N$.\n\nHowever, what happens if we use a weighted approach to determine how to\ndistribute our samples across the terms of the Hamiltonian? In\n**weighted random sampling** (WRS), the number of shots used to\ndetermine the expectation value $\\langle h_i\\rangle$ is a discrete\nrandom variable distributed according to a [multinomial\ndistribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution),\n\n$$S \\sim \\text{Multinomial}(p_i),$$\n\nwith event probabilities\n\n$$p_i = \\frac{|c_i|}{\\sum_i |c_i|}.$$\n\nThat is, the number of shots assigned to the measurement of the\nexpectation value of the $i\\text{th}$ term of the Hamiltonian is drawn\nfrom a probability distribution *proportional to the magnitude of its\ncoefficient* $c_i$.\n\nTo see this strategy in action, consider the Hamiltonian\n\n$$H = 2I\\otimes X + 4 I\\otimes Z  - X\\otimes X + 5Y\\otimes Y + 2 Z\\otimes X.$$\n\nWe can solve for the ground state energy using the variational quantum\neigensolver (VQE) algorithm.\n\nFirst, let\\'s import NumPy and PennyLane, and define our Hamiltonian.\n"

        "Rosalin: Frugal shot optimization\n=================================\n\nWe can see above that both methods optimize fairly well; weighted random\nsampling converges just as well as evenly distributing the shots across\nall Hamiltonian terms. However, deterministic shot distribution\napproaches will always have a minimum shot value required per\nexpectation value, as below this threshold they become biased\nestimators. This is not the case with random sampling; as we saw in the\n`doubly stochastic gradient descent demonstration </demos/tutorial_doubly_stochastic>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"}, the introduction of randomness allows for as little as a\nsingle shot per expectation term, while still remaining an unbiased\nestimator.\n\nUsing this insight, Arrasmith et al. modified the iCANS frugal\nshot-optimization technique to include weighted random sampling, making\nit \\'doubly stochastic\\'.\n\niCANS optimizer\n---------------\n\nTwo variants of the iCANS optimizer were introduced in K\u00fcbler et al.,\niCANS1 and iCANS2. The iCANS1 optimizer, on which Rosalin is based,\nfrugally distributes a shot budget across the partial derivatives of\neach parameter, which are computed using the\n`parameter-shift rule </glossary/quantum_gradient>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"}. It works roughly as follows:\n\n1.  The initial step of the optimizer is performed with some specified\n    minimum number of shots, $s_{min}$, for all partial derivatives.\n\n2.  The parameter-shift rule is then used to estimate the gradient $g_i$\n    for each parameter $\\theta_i$, parameters, as well as the\n    *variances* $v_i$ of the estimated gradients.\n\n3.  Gradient descent is performed for each parameter $\\theta_i$, using\n    the pre-defined learning rate $\\alpha$ and the gradient information\n    $g_i$:\n\n    $$\\theta_i = \\theta_i - \\alpha g_i.$$\n\n4.  The improvement in the cost function per shot, for a specific\n    parameter value, is then calculated via\n\n    $$\\gamma_i = \\frac{1}{s_i} \\left[ \\left(\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2} L\\alpha^2\\right)\n                g_i^2 - \\frac{L\\alpha^2}{2s_i}v_i \\right],$$\n\n    where:\n\n    -   $L \\leq \\sum_i|c_i|$ is the bound on the [Lipschitz\n        constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity) of\n        the variational quantum algorithm objective function,\n    -   $c_i$ are the coefficients of the Hamiltonian, and\n    -   $\\alpha$ is the learning rate, and *must* be bound such that\n        $\\alpha < 2/L$ for the above expression to hold.\n\n5.  Finally, the new values of $s_i$ (shots for partial derivative of\n    parameter $\\theta_i$) is given by:\n\n    $$s_i = \\frac{2L\\alpha}{2-L\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{v_i}{g_i^2}\\right)\\propto\n          \\frac{v_i}{g_i^2}.$$\n\nIn addition to the above, to counteract the presence of noise in the\nsystem, a running average of $g_i$ and $s_i$ ($\\chi_i$ and $\\xi_i$\nrespectively) are used when computing $\\gamma_i$ and $s_i$.\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nIn classical machine learning, the Lipschitz constant of the cost\nfunction is generally unknown. However, for a variational quantum\nalgorithm with cost of the form\n$f(x) = \\langle \\psi(x) | \\hat{H} |\\psi(x)\\rangle$, an upper bound on\nthe Lipschitz constant is given by $L < \\sum_i|c_i|$, where $c_i$ are\nthe coefficients of $\\hat{H}$ when decomposed into a linear combination\nof Pauli-operator tensor products.\n:::\n\nRosalin implementation\n----------------------\n\nLet\\'s now modify iCANS above to incorporate weighted random sampling of\nHamiltonian terms --- the Rosalin frugal shot optimizer.\n\nRosalin takes several hyper-parameters:\n\n-   `min_shots`: the minimum number of shots used to estimate the\n    expectations of each term in the Hamiltonian. Note that this must be\n    larger than 2 for the variance of the gradients to be computed.\n-   `mu`: The running average constant $\\mu\\in[0, 1]$. Used to control\n    how quickly the number of shots recommended for each gradient\n    component changes.\n-   `b`: Regularization bias. The bias should be kept small, but\n    non-zero.\n-   `lr`: The learning rate. Recall from above that the learning rate\n    *must* be such that $\\alpha < 2/L = 2/\\sum_i|c_i|$.\n\nSince the Rosalin optimizer has a state that must be preserved between\noptimization steps, let\\'s use a class to create our optimizer.\n"
