        "Alleviating barren plateaus with local cost functions\n=====================================================\n\n::: {.meta}\n:property=\\\"og:description\\\": Local cost functions are cost formulations\nfor variational quantum circuits that are more robust to barren\nplateaus. :property=\\\"og:image\\\":\n../demonstrations/local\\_cost\\_functions/Cerezo\\_et\\_al\\_local\\_cost\\_functions.png\n:::\n\n::: {.related}\ntutorial\\_barren\\_plateaus Barren plateaus in quantum neural networks\n:::\n\n*Author: Thomas Storwick --- Posted: 09 September 2020. Last updated: 28\nJanuary 2021.*\n\nBarren Plateaus\n---------------\n\n`Barren plateaus </demos/tutorial_barren_plateaus>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"} are large regions of the cost function\\'s parameter space\nwhere the variance of the gradient is almost 0; or, put another way, the\ncost function landscape is flat. This means that a variational circuit\ninitialized in one of these areas will be untrainable using any\ngradient-based algorithm.\n\nIn [\\\"Cost-Function-Dependent Barren Plateaus in Shallow Quantum Neural\nNetworks\\\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00550), Cerezo et al. demonstrate\nthe idea that the barren plateau phenomenon can, under some\ncircumstances, be avoided by using cost functions that only have\ninformation from part of the circuit. These *local* cost functions can\nbe more robust against noise, and may have better-behaved gradients with\nno plateaus for shallow circuits.\n\n![Taken from Cerezo et\nal..](../demonstrations/local_cost_functions/Cerezo_et_al_local_cost_functions.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nMany variational quantum algorithms are constructed to use global cost\nfunctions. Information from the entire measurement is used to analyze\nthe result of the circuit, and a cost function is calculated from this\nto quantify the circuit\\'s performance. A local cost function only\nconsiders information from a few qubits, and attempts to analyze the\nbehavior of the entire circuit from this limited scope.\n\nCerezo et al. also handily prove that these local cost functions are\nbounded by the global ones, i.e., if a global cost function is\nformulated in the manner described by Cerezo et al., then the value of\nits corresponding local cost function will always be less than or equal\nto the value of the global cost function.\n\nIn this notebook, we investigate the effect of barren plateaus in\nvariational quantum algorithms, and how they can be mitigated using\nlocal cost functions.\n\nWe first need to import the following modules.\n"

For this\nsimple example, an ansatz that works well is simply a rotation along X,\nand a rotation along Y, repeated across all the qubits.\n\nWe will also define our cost functions here. Since we are trying to\nlearn the identity gate, a natural cost function is 1 minus the\nprobability of measuring the zero state, denoted here as\n$1 - p_{|0\\rangle}$.\n\n$$C = \\langle  \\psi(\\theta) | \\left(I - |0\\rangle \\langle 0|\\right)  | \\psi(\\theta)  \\rangle   =1-p_{|0\\rangle}$$\n\nWe will apply this across all qubits for our global cost function, i.e.,\n\n$$C_{G} = \\langle  \\psi(\\theta) | \\left(I - |00 \\ldots 0\\rangle \\langle 00 \\ldots 0|\\right) | \\psi(\\theta) \\rangle  = 1-p_{|00 \\ldots 0\\rangle}$$\n\nand for the local cost function, we will sum the individual\ncontributions from each qubit:\n\n$$C_L = \\langle \\psi(\\theta) | \\left(I - \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_j |0\\rangle \\langle 0|_j\\right)|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle = 1 - \\sum_j p_{|0\\rangle_j}.$$\n\nIt might be clear to some readers now why this function can perform\nbetter. By formatting our local cost function in this way, we have\nessentially divided the problem up into multiple single-qubit terms, and\nsummed all the results up.\n\nTo implement this, we will define a separate QNode for the local cost\nfunction and the global cost function.\n"

        "In the global case, anywhere between 70-80% of starting positions are\nuntrainable, a significant number. It is likely that, as the complexity\nof our ansatz---and the number of qubits---increases, this factor will\nincrease.\n\nWe can compare that to our local cost function, where every single area\ntrained, and most even trained in less time. While these examples are\nsimple, this local-vs-global cost behaviour has been shown to extend to\nmore complex problems.\n"
