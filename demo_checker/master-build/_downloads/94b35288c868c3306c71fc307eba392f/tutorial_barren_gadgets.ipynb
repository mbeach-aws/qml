Last updated: 09\nDecember 2022.*\n\nVariational quantum algorithms are seen as one of the most primising\ncandidates for useful applications of quantum computers in the near\nterm, but there are still a few hurdles to overcome when it comes to\npractical implementation. One of them, is the trainability. In other\nwords, one needs to ensure that the cost function is not flat. In this\ntutorial, we will explore the application of perturbative gadgets in\nvariational quantum algorithms to outgo the issue of\ncost-function-dependent barren plateaus, as proposed in Ref.\n\nSome context\n============\n\nBarren plateaus refer to the phenomenon where the gradients of the cost\nfunction decay exponentially with the size of the problem. Essentially,\nthe cost landscape becomes flat, with exception of some small regions,\ne.g., around the minimum. That is a problem because increasing the\nprecision of the cost function requires more measurements from the\nquantum device due to shot noise, and an exponential number of\nmeasurements would render the algorithm impractical. If you are not\nfamiliar yet with the concept of barren plateaus, I recommend you first\ncheck out the demonstrations on\n`barren plateaus </demos/tutorial_barren_plateaus>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"} and\n`avoiding barren plateaus with local cost functions </demos/tutorial_local_cost_functions>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"}.\n\nAs presented in the second aforementioned demo, barren plateaus are more\nsevere when using global cost functions compared to local ones. A global\ncost function requires the simultaneous measurement of all qubits at\nonce. In contrast, a local one is constructed from terms that only act\non a small subset of qubits.\n\nWe want to explore this topic further and learn about one possible\nmitigation strategy. Thinking about Variational Quantum Eigensolver\n(VQE) applications, let us consider cost functions that are expectation\nvalues of Hamiltonians such as\n\n$$C(\\theta) = \\operatorname{Tr} \\left[ H V(\\theta) |00\\ldots 0\\rangle \\! \\langle 00\\ldots 0| V(\\theta)^\\dagger\\right].$$\n\nHere $|00\\ldots 0\\rangle$ is our initial state, $V(\\theta)$ is the\ncircuit ansatz and $H$ the Hamiltonian whose expectation value we need\nto minimize. In some cases, it is easy to find a local cost function\nwhich can substitute a global one with the same ground state. Take, for\ninstance, the following Hamiltonians that induce global and local cost\nfunctions, respectively.\n\n$$H_G = \\mathbb{I} - |00\\ldots 0\\rangle \\! \\langle 00\\ldots 0| \\quad \\textrm{ and } \\quad H_L = \\mathbb{I} - \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_j |0\\rangle \\! \\langle 0|_j.$$\n\nThose are two different Hamiltonians (not just different formulations of\nthe same one), but they share the same ground state:\n\n$$|\\psi_{\\textrm{min}} \\rangle =  |00\\ldots 0\\rangle.$$\n\nTherefore, one can work with either Hamiltonian to perform the VQE\nroutine. However, it is not always so simple. What if we want to find\nthe minimum eigenenergy of\n$H = X \\otimes X \\otimes Y \\otimes Z + Z \\otimes Y \\otimes X \\otimes X$\n? It is not always trivial to construct a local cost function that has\nthe same minimum as the cost function of interest. This is where\nperturbative gadgets come into play!\n\nThe definitions\n===============\n\nPerturbative gadgets are a common tool in adiabatic quantum computing.\nTheir goal is to find a Hamiltonian with local interactions that mimics\nanother Hamiltonian with more complex couplings.\n\nIdeally, they would want to implement the target Hamiltonian with\ncomplex couplings, but since it\\'s hard to implement more than few-body\ninteractions on hardware, they cannot do so. Perturbative gadgets work\nby increasing the dimension of the Hilbert space (i.e., the number of\nqubits) and \\\"encoding\\\" the target Hamiltonian in the low-energy\nsubspace of a so-called \\\"gadget\\\" Hamiltonian.\n\nLet us now construct such a gadget Hamiltonian tailored for VQE\napplications. First, we start from a target Hamiltonian that is a linear\ncombination of Pauli words acting on $k$ qubits each:\n\n$$H^\\text{target} = \\sum_i c_i h_i,$$\n\nwhere\n$h_i = \\sigma_{i,1} \\otimes \\sigma_{i,2} \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes \\sigma_{i,k}$,\n$\\sigma_{i,j} \\in \\{ X, Y, Z \\}$, and $c_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Now we\nconstruct the gadget Hamiltonian. For each term $h_i$, we will need $k$\nadditional qubits, which we call auxiliary qubits, and to add two terms\nto the Hamiltonian: an \\\"unperturbed\\\" part $H^\\text{aux}_i$ and a\nperturbation $V_i$ of strength $\\lambda$. The unperturbed part penalizes\neach of the newly added qubits for not being in the $|0\\rangle$ state\n\n$$H^\\text{aux}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^k |1\\rangle \\! \\langle 1|_{i,j} = \\sum_{j=1}^k \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbb{I} - Z_{i,j}).$$\n\nOn the other hand, the perturbation part implements one of the operators\nin the Pauli word $\\sigma_{i,j}$ on the corresponding qubit of the\ntarget register and a pair of Pauli $X$ gates on two of the auxiliary\nqubits:\n\n$$V_i = \\sum_{j=1}^k c_{i,j} \\sigma_{i,j} \\otimes X_{i,j} \\otimes X_{i,(j+1) \\mathrm{mod }k}.$$\n\nIn the end,\n\n$$H^\\text{gad} = \\sum_{i} \\left( H^\\text{aux}_i + \\lambda V_i \\right).$$\n\nTo grasp this idea better, this is what would result from working with a\nHamiltonian acting on a total of $8$ qubits and having $3$ terms, each\nof them being a $4$-body interaction.\n\n![](../demonstrations/barren_gadgets/gadget-terms-tutorial.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"90.0%\"}\n\nFor each of the terms $h_1$, $h_2$, and $h_3$ we add $4$ auxiliary\nqubits. In the end, our gadget Hamiltonian acts on $8+3\\cdot 4 = 20$\nqubits.\n\nThe penalization (red) acts only on the auxiliary registers, penalizing\neach qubit individually, while the perturbations couple the target with\nthe auxiliary qubits.\n\nAs shown in Ref., this construction results in a spectrum that, for low\nenergies, is similar to that of the original Hamiltonian. This means\nthat by minimizing the gadget Hamiltonian and reaching its global\nminimum, the resulting state will be close to the global minimum of\n$H^\\text{target}$.\n\nSince it is a local cost function, it is better behaved with respect to\nbarren plateaus than the global cost function, making it more trainable.\nAs a result, one can mitigate the onset of cost-function-dependent\nbarren plateaus by substituting the global cost function with the\nresulting gadget and using that for training instead. That is what we\nwill do in the rest of this tutorial.\n"
