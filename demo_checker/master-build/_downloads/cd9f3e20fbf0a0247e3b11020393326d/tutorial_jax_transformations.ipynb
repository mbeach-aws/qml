Last updated: 12 April\n2021.*\n\nJAX is an incredibly powerful scientific computing library that has been\ngaining traction in both the physics and deep learning communities.\nWhile JAX was originally designed for classical machine learning (ML),\nmany of its transformations are also useful for quantum machine learning\n(QML), and can be used directly with PennyLane.\n"

        "![](../demonstrations/jax_logo/jax.png){.align-center width=\"50.0%\"}\n\nIn this tutorial, we\\'ll go over a number of JAX transformations and\nshow how you can use them to build and optimize quantum circuits. We\\'ll\nshow examples of how to do gradient descent with `jax.grad`, run quantum\ncircuits in parallel using `jax.vmap`, compile and optimize simulations\nwith `jax.jit`, and control and seed the random nature of quantum\ncomputer simulations with `jax.random`. By the end of this tutorial you\nshould feel just as comfortable transforming quantum computing programs\nwith JAX as you do transforming your neural networks.\n\nIf this is your first time reading PennyLane code, we recommend going\nthrough the\n`basic tutorial </demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"} first. It\\'s all in vanilla NumPy, so you should be able to\neasily transfer what you learn to JAX when you come back.\n\nWith that said, we begin by importing PennyLane, JAX, the JAX-provided\nversion of NumPy and set up a two-qubit device for computations. We\\'ll\nbe using the `default.qubit` device for the first part of this tutorial.\n"
