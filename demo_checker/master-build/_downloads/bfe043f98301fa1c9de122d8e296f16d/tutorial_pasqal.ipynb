        "Quantum computation with neutral atoms\n======================================\n\n::: {.meta}\n:property=\\\"og:description\\\": Neutral atom quantum devices allow you to\nplace qubits within interesting three-dimensional configurations.\n:property=\\\"og:image\\\":\n<https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/pasqal_thumbnail.png>\n:::\n\n::: {.related}\nahs\\_aquila Pulse programming on neutral atom hardware\n:::\n\n*Author: Nathan Killoran --- Posted: 13 October 2020. Last updated: 21\nJanuary 2021.*\n\nQuantum computing architectures come in many flavours: superconducting\nqubits, ion traps, photonics, silicon, and more. One very interesting\nphysical substrate is *neutral atoms*. These quantum devices have some\nbasic similarities to ion traps. Ion-trap devices make use of atoms that\nhave an imbalance between protons (positively charged) and electrons\n(negatively charged). Neutral atoms, on the other hand, have an equal\nnumber of protons and electrons.\n\nIn neutral-atom systems, the individual atoms can be easily programmed\ninto various two- or three-dimensional configurations. Like ion-trap\nsystems, individual qubits can be encoded into the energy levels of the\natoms. The qubits thus retain the three-dimensional geometry of their\nhost atoms. Qubits that are nearby in space can be programmed to\ninteract with one another via two-qubit gates. This opens up some\ntantalizing possibilities for exotic quantum-computing circuit\ntopologies.\n\n![..](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhenriet/cirq-pasqal/fc4f9c7792a8737fde76d4c05828aa538be8452e/pasqal-tutorials/files/eiffel_tower.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nNeutral atoms (green dots) arranged in various configurations. These\natoms can be used to encode qubits and carry out quantum computations.\nImage originally from.\n\nThe startup [Pasqal](https://pasqal.io/) is one of the companies working\nto bring neutral-atom quantum computing devices to the world. To support\nthis new class of devices, Pasqal has contributed some new features to\nthe quantum software library\n[Cirq](https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\nIn this demo, we will use PennyLane, Cirq, and TensorFlow to show off\nthe unique abilities of neutral atom devices, leveraging them to make a\nvariational quantum circuit which has a very unique topology: *the\nEiffel tower*. Specifically, we will build a simple toy circuit whose\nqubits are arranged like the Eiffel tower. The girders between the\npoints on the tower will represent two-qubit gates, with the final\noutput of our variational circuit coming at the very peak of the tower.\n\nLet\\'s get to it!\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nTo run this demo locally, you will need to install\n[Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq), (version \\>= 0.9.1), and the\n[PennyLane-cirq\nplugin](https://pennylane-cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (version \\>=\n0.13). You will also need to download a copy of the data, which is\navailable\n[here](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/qml/blob/master/demonstrations/pasqal/Eiffel_tower_data.dat).\n:::\n"

        "Converting to Cirq qubits\n=========================\n\nOur next step will be to convert these datapoints into objects that Cirq\nunderstands as qubits. For neutral-atom devices in Cirq, we can use the\n`ThreeDQubit` class, which carries information about the\nthree-dimensional arrangement of the qubits.\n\nNow, neutral-atom devices come with some physical restrictions.\nSpecifically, in a particular three-dimensional configuration, qubits\nthat are too distant from one another can\\'t easily interact. Instead,\nthere is a notion of a *control radius;* any atoms which are within the\nsystem\\'s control radius can interact with one another.

        "Creating a quantum circuit\n==========================\n\nWe will now make a variational circuit out of the Eiffel tower\nconfiguration from above.

We will cause these\nqubits to interact by applying a sequence of two-qubit gates.\nSpecifically, the circuit consists of several stages:\n\ni.  Input classical data is converted into quantum information at the\n    first (lowest) vertical level of qubits. In this example, our\n    classical data will be simple bit strings, which we can embed by\n    using single-qubit bit flips (a simple\n    [data-embedding](https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/quantum_embedding.html)\n    strategy).\nii. For each corner of the tower, CNOTs are enacted between the\n    first-and second-level qubits.\niii. All qubits from the second level interact with a single \\\"peak\\\"\n     qubit using a parametrized controlled-rotation operation. The free\n     parameters of our variational circuit enter here.\n\nThe output of our circuit is determined via a Pauli-Z measurement on the\nfinal \\\"peak\\\" qubit.\n\nThat\\'s a few things to keep track of, so let\\'s show the circuit via a\nthree-dimensional image:\n"
