Last updated: 30 June\n2022.*\n\nThis demo is based on the article [Quantum advantage in learning from\nexperiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00778) [\\[1\\]](#ref1) by\nHsin-Yuan Huang and co-authors. The article investigates the following\nquestion:\n\n*How useful is access to quantum memory for quantum machine learning?*\n\nThey show that access to quantum memory can make a big difference, and\nprove that there exist learning problems for which algorithms with\nquantum memory require *exponentially less resources* than those\nwithout. We look at one learning task studied in [\\[1\\]](#ref1) for\nwhich this is the case.\n\nThe learning task\n-----------------\n\nThe learning task we focus on involves deciding if a unitary is\ntime-reversal symmetric (we'll call them T-symmetric) or not.\nMathematically, time-reversal symmetry in quantum mechanics involves\nreversing the sense of $i$ so that $i \\rightarrow -i$. Hence, a unitary\n$U$ is T-symmetric if\n\n$$U^*=U.$$\n\nNow for the learning task. Let's say we have a bunch of quantum circuits\n$U_1, \\cdots, U_n$, some of which are T-symmetric and some not, but we\nare not told which ones are which.\n"
