Greetings, quantum adventurers! In this exciting tutorial, we’ll be exploring the concept of quantum
phase kickback, used in many quantum algorithms such as the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, and quantum phase
estimation. Here, we'll be utilizing it to create a “quantum lock”. Are you ready to dive into the quantum
world and learn how to create an unbreakable lock? Let’s go!

Introduction to phase kickback
------------------------------

Phase kickback is a powerful quantum phenomenon that uses entanglement properties to allow for the transfer of phase information from a
target register to a control qubit. It plays a vital role in the design of many quantum algorithms.

In a phase kickback circuit, an ancilla qubit is prepared in a superposition state using a Hadamard
gate and it acts as a control qubit for a controlled unitary gate applied to the target register. When
the target register is in an eigenstate of the unitary gate, the corresponding eigenvalue’s phase is
“kicked back” to the control qubit. A subsequent Hadamard gate on the ancilla qubit enables the
extraction of the phase information through measurement.

Setting up PennyLane
--------------------

First, let’s import the necessary PennyLane libraries and create a device to run our quantum
circuits. Here we will work with 5 qubits, we will use qubit [0] as the control ancilla qubit, and qubits [1,2,3,4] will be our target qubits where we will encode :math:`|\psi\rangle`.

Building the quantum lock
-------------------------

Now let’s create the most formidable lock in the universe: the “quantum lock”! Here our lock is
represented by a unitary :math:`U`, which has all but one eigenvalue equal to 1. Our one “key” eigenstate
has eigenvalue -1:

.. math:: U|\text{key}\rangle = -|\text{key}\rangle

But how can we differentiate the "key" eigenstate from the other eigenstate when the information is contained in the phase?
That's where phase kickback comes in! When the correct eigenstate is input, the -1 phase imparted by :math:`U` is kicked back to
the ancilla, effectively changing its state from :math:`|+\rangle` to :math:`|-\rangle`.
Then the outcome of the measurement on the control qubit tells us whether the correct eigenstate was inputted or not.
In this case, :math:`|1\rangle = H|-\rangle` represents unlocking the lock, and :math:`|0\rangle = H|+\rangle` represents failure. To make
things simple, here we’ll work with a lock-in computational basis. In this setting, the key
corresponds to a binary encoded integer :math:`m` , which will be our key eigenstate:

.. math::


     U|n\rangle =
     \begin{cases}
       -|n\rangle, & \text{if } n=m \\
       |n\rangle, & \text{if } n\neq m
     \end{cases}

We’ll make use of :class:`~.pennylane.FlipSign` to build our lock:

Next, we need to prepare the corresponding eigenstate for a key we want to try out. Remember, the lock is only unlocked by the "key" eigenstate with eigenvalue -1. We’ll make use of
:class:`~.pennylane.BasisState` to build the key:

Now we’ll put it all together to build our quantum locking mechanism:

Opening the Quantum Lock
------------------------

To open the quantum lock, we’ll need the correct input state or “quantum key”. Let’s see how the
quantum system evolves when we input the right key.

We first apply a Hadamard to our control qubit:

.. math:: \frac{|0\rangle|\text{key}\rangle + |1\rangle|\text{key}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}

By applying the controlled unitary operation we get:

.. math:: \frac{|0\rangle|\text{key}\rangle - |1\rangle|\text{key}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} = |-\rangle|\text{key}\rangle

Finally, we apply a Hadamard to our control qubit again to get:

.. math:: |1\rangle|\text{key}\rangle

And just like that, we’ve uncovered the quantum secrets hidden by the lock. Let’s now crack open our
quantum lock in code!

What happens with an incorrect quantum key?
-------------------------------------------

Now, we’ll try using the wrong key and see if we can still unlock the quantum lock. Will we be able
to break through its quantum defenses? Let’s see how the quantum system evolves when we input the
wrong key.

We first apply a Hadamard to our control qubit:

.. math:: \frac{|0\rangle|\text{incorrect key}\rangle + |1\rangle|\text{incorrect key}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}

Applying the controlled unitary operation, in this case, acts as the identity gate, hence we get:

.. math:: \frac{|0\rangle|\text{incorrect key}\rangle + |1\rangle|\text{incorrect key}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} = |+\rangle|\text{incorrect key}\rangle

Finally, we apply a Hadamard to our control qubit again to get:

.. math:: |0\rangle|\text{incorrect key}\rangle

As you can see, we were unable to fool the almighty lock. Don’t believe me? See for yourself!
